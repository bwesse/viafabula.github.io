## Chapter: Morocco, Where the World Keeps Arriving

Morocco is in North Africa. It has the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Europe is near. Morocco also has big mountains. The mountains are called the Atlas Mountains. The sea and the mountains are important for Morocco’s history.

People lived in Morocco a long time ago. The Amazigh people lived there first. They lived in the mountains, in the plains, and near oases. They had their own languages and traditions. Later, other people came to Morocco too.

Morocco had trade by the sea. Long ago, Carthage had contact with North Africa. Later, the Roman Empire came to parts of Morocco. The Romans built roads and towns. But Morocco was far from Rome, so Rome did not control everything.

Today, we can see Roman ruins in Morocco. Volubilis is a famous place with old Roman buildings. It shows that different cultures met in Morocco. Roman culture came, but local life stayed strong too.

Later, Islam came to North Africa in the 7th and 8th centuries. Many people became Muslim. But there were also fights and revolts. Some Amazigh groups did not accept outside rule easily.

After this, Morocco had early rulers. The Idrisid dynasty started in the north. Idris I began to rule, and Idris II continued. This was an early step to build a Moroccan state.

Cities became important. Fez was founded in the 9th century. It became a big city for religion and learning. Many people studied there, and it became famous.

Later, Morocco had strong dynasties. The Almoravids became powerful and built a big empire. They founded Marrakesh as a capital. Marrakesh became an important city.

After them, the Almohads became powerful too. They also built a large empire. They ruled Morocco and other places. They wanted strong unity in religion and politics.

Over time, Morocco had changes and conflicts. Sometimes different regions fought. But Morocco often became strong again after difficult times.

Morocco also grew with culture. People built beautiful buildings. Crafts and trade were important. Morocco traded with the Mediterranean and also with areas south of the Sahara.

In the 16th century, Europe became stronger at sea. European powers wanted ports and trade. In this time, the Saʿdi dynasty became strong in Morocco and helped defend the country.

A famous Saʿdi ruler was Ahmad al-Mansur. Morocco became stronger during his time. Morocco also used diplomacy to deal with other countries.

After the Saʿdi period, Morocco had instability. Later, the ʿAlawite dynasty began in the 17th century. This dynasty still rules Morocco today.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, European powers controlled more of Morocco. In 1912, Morocco became a French protectorate, and Spain controlled some areas. Morocco had less independence.

Moroccans resisted colonial rule. Nationalist movements grew. People wanted independence and worked for it in different ways.

In 1956, Morocco became independent. Sultan Muhammad V was an important symbol of independence. After independence, Morocco had to build a modern government.

After Muhammad V died, Hassan II became king in 1961. He ruled for many years. Morocco had political tensions, and the state became more centralised.

A big modern issue is Western Sahara. In 1975, Morocco supported its claim there. Many people joined the Green March. The dispute continued for a long time.

Western Sahara is still important today. It affects Morocco’s politics and relations with other countries.

In 1999, Mohammed VI became king. Morocco continued modernisation and reforms. In 2011, Morocco changed the constitution after protests in the region.

Morocco has different regions today. The coast, the mountains, and the desert are different. Amazigh traditions and Arabic-Islamic culture are both important.

Northern Morocco is close to Europe. Tangier is an important city with international connections. The coast is Morocco’s gateway to the world.

Morocco’s history has many changes. Many rulers came and went. Other powers tried to control Morocco. But Morocco continued and kept its identity.

Morocco learned from many influences. But it stayed itself. Morocco’s story is about staying strong while the world keeps arriving.
