My Journey to Marrakesh

Last March, I finally fulfilled my dream of visiting Marrakesh. I had been planning this trip for over a year, and the excitement was overwhelming as my plane descended over the red city.

The moment I stepped out of the airport, I felt the warm Moroccan sun on my face. A taxi driver named Hassan greeted me with a friendly smile and drove me to my riad in the medina. The narrow streets were too small for cars, so I had to walk the last part with my luggage.

My riad was like a hidden palace. From the outside, it looked like any other building, but inside, there was a beautiful courtyard with a fountain, orange trees, and colorful tiles everywhere. The owner, Fatima, welcomed me with mint tea and pastries.

The next morning, I woke up early to explore. The medina was already buzzing with life. Shopkeepers were opening their stores, and the smell of fresh bread filled the air. I wandered through the souks, where craftsmen were making leather goods, lamps, and carpets by hand.

At midday, I reached Jemaa el-Fnaa square. What an incredible place! There were snake charmers, musicians, storytellers, and acrobats performing everywhere. I watched a group of Gnawa musicians playing their distinctive music while people gathered around them.

For lunch, I tried my first tagine at a small restaurant recommended by Fatima. The lamb was so tender it fell off the bone, and the combination of spices was unlike anything I had tasted before. I also learned to eat with my right hand, using bread to scoop up the food, following local customs.

In the afternoon, I visited the Majorelle Garden. Created by the French painter Jacques Majorelle, it was an oasis of calm compared to the busy medina. The bright blue buildings contrasted beautifully with the green plants and cacti. I spent an hour just sitting there, reading and relaxing.

That evening, I climbed to the rooftop terrace of a café to watch the sunset. As the sky turned orange and pink, the call to prayer echoed across the city from various mosques. It was a magical moment that I'll never forget.

Over the next few days, I explored more of Marrakesh. I visited the Bahia Palace with its stunning architecture, bargained for spices in the souks (and probably still paid too much!), and took a cooking class where I learned to make traditional Moroccan dishes.

One day, I hired a guide to take me to the Atlas Mountains, just outside the city. We visited Berber villages and saw how people live in the mountains. The contrast between the mountain life and city life was fascinating.

On my last night, I returned to Jemaa el-Fnaa square. This time, I was braver and tried the street food. I ate grilled sardines and harira soup while watching the square come alive with evening entertainment. The atmosphere was electric.

Leaving Marrakesh was hard. The city had captured my heart with its colors, sounds, smells, and the warmth of its people. I promised myself I would return someday to discover more of its secrets.
