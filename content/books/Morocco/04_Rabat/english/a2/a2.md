I visited Rabat last summer. It was my first time in Morocco.

Rabat is Morocco's elegant capital with its blend of historic sites and modern amenities. I arrived in the morning. The weather was warm and sunny.

I stayed in a small hotel near the center. The people were very friendly. They helped me with my bags.

Every day, I walked around the city. I saw the Hassan Tower, Royal Palace, Kasbah of the Udayas, and the mausoleum of Mohammed V. The streets were full of life. There were many shops and cafes.

I tried the local food. The tagine was delicious. I also drank mint tea every afternoon. It was very sweet and refreshing.

The architecture was amazing. The buildings had beautiful colors and patterns. I took many photos.

At night, the city came alive. There was music and dancing. The atmosphere was magical.

I met other travelers from different countries. We shared stories about our trips. I made new friends.

On my last day, I bought some souvenirs. I got spices, a carpet, and some pottery. I was sad to leave.

Rabat was an incredible experience. I want to return someday. Morocco has so much to offer. I recommend it to everyone.
