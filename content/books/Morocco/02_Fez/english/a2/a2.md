Discovering Fez: Morocco's Spiritual Heart

When I told friends I was visiting Fez instead of Marrakesh, many looked confused. "Isn't Marrakesh the famous one?" they asked. But Fez, Morocco's cultural and spiritual capital, had been calling to me for years, and I was finally ready to answer.

I arrived on a cloudy November morning. The taxi driver who picked me up from the airport was eager to share his love for his city. "Fez is special," he said. "It's where Morocco's soul lives." At the time, I thought he was just being poetic, but I would soon understand what he meant.

My hotel was just outside the medina walls. The medina of Fez el-Bali is one of the largest car-free urban areas in the world, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage site. The next morning, I hired a guide named Omar to help me navigate the maze-like streets. This turned out to be an excellent decision – I would have been hopelessly lost on my own.

Our first stop was the University of al-Qarawiyyin, founded in 859 CE by Fatima al-Fihri, a woman. Omar explained with pride that this is recognized by UNESCO and the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest continuously operating university in the world. Although non-Muslims couldn't enter, I could peek through the doors at the beautiful courtyard and imagine centuries of scholars studying there.

As we walked deeper into the medina, Omar pointed out architectural details I would have missed. The doors were particularly fascinating – each one told a story through its design, colors, and decorations. He explained that historically, you could tell a family's profession and status from their door.

The famous Chouara Tannery was our next destination. Before we got there, Omar gave me a sprig of fresh mint. "Hold this to your nose," he advised. I soon understood why. The tannery uses ancient methods that haven't changed in a thousand years, including pigeon droppings and cow urine to treat the leather. The smell was intense!

But watching the tanners work was mesmerizing. Men stood waist-deep in large stone vessels filled with colored dyes – vibrant reds, deep blues, sunny yellows. They were dyeing the leather by hand, just as their ancestors had done. The colors created a patchwork pattern that was strangely beautiful despite the harsh working conditions.

From a terrace above the tannery, I photographed the scene while Omar told me about the challenges facing traditional crafts. Many young people don't want to continue in their fathers' footsteps because the work is hard and doesn't pay well. Tourism helps keep these traditions alive, but it also changes them.

We spent the afternoon exploring different sections of the souk. Unlike Marrakesh's touristy markets, the Fez souks still primarily serve local people. I watched copper workers hammering intricate designs into trays, weavers creating silk scarves, and woodworkers carving elaborate patterns into cedar wood.

Omar took me to a tiny restaurant hidden in the medina for lunch. I had bastilla, a sweet and savory pie made with layers of thin pastry, pigeon meat, almonds, and cinnamon, dusted with powdered sugar. It was unlike anything I had ever tasted – the combination of sweet and savory was surprising but delicious.

That evening, I attended a Sufi music concert at a cultural center. The musicians played traditional instruments while singing devotional poetry. Even though I couldn't understand the Arabic lyrics, the emotion in the music was universal. People swayed to the rhythm, some with tears in their eyes.

Over the next few days, I explored more of Fez. I visited the Bou Inania Madrasa, a theological college with such stunning tilework and carved stucco that I spent two hours just admiring the details. I walked along the city walls and visited the Royal Palace, with its famous golden doors.

One afternoon, I got completely lost in the medina. My phone's GPS was useless in the narrow covered streets, and I couldn't remember how to get back to my hotel. Instead of panicking, I decided to embrace the experience. I wandered for hours, discovering hidden squares, quiet residential neighborhoods, and small mosques tucked away from tourist routes.

Eventually, a kind shopkeeper noticed my confused expression and asked if I needed help. He didn't speak much English, and I didn't speak much Arabic, but through gestures and a few words, he guided me back to a street I recognized. He refused the money I offered, saying "Welcome to Fez" with a warm smile.

On my last day, I returned to the medina alone, without a guide. I felt more confident now, able to navigate the main routes and even recognize some landmarks. I bought spices, a leather journal from the tannery district, and a small ceramic dish painted with traditional patterns.

As I left Fez, I understood what the taxi driver had meant about the city's soul. Fez isn't trying to be a tourist attraction. It's a living, breathing city where traditions continue not for show, but because they're woven into daily life. The calls to prayer, the craftsmen in their workshops, the students at the university – all of this continues as it has for centuries.

Marrakesh may be more famous, but Fez offers something deeper – a chance to witness authenticity, to see a medieval city that hasn't been frozen in time but continues to evolve while staying true to its roots.
