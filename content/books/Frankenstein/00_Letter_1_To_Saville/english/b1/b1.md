Letter 1

*To Mrs. Saville, England.*

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.

You will be glad to hear that nothing bad has happened at the start of the journey you were so worried about. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to tell my dear sister that I am safe and that I feel more confident about success.

I am already far north of London, and when I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern wind on my cheeks. It makes me feel strong and happy. Do you know this feeling? This wind has travelled from the places I am going to, and it gives me a first taste of those icy lands. With this hopeful wind, my daydreams become stronger and clearer.

I try, but I cannot believe that the pole is only a place of ice and emptiness. In my imagination it is a place of beauty and joy. There, Margaret, the sun is always visible. It stays close to the horizon and gives a constant light. There—and with your permission, my sister, I will trust the stories of earlier sailors—snow and frost are gone. And if we sail on a calm sea, we may reach a land that is more wonderful and more beautiful than any place people have discovered so far on earth.

Its plants and landscapes may be unlike anything we have ever seen. The skies and stars may also look different in those unknown places. What might we not find in a land of endless light? I may discover the strange power that pulls the compass needle. I may also make many observations of the sky clearer, because this voyage could explain things that seem confusing now. I will satisfy my strong curiosity by seeing a part of the world no one has visited before, and I may walk on land where no human has ever walked.

These hopes attract me, and they are enough to take away my fear of danger or death. They make me start this hard voyage with the joy of a child who goes in a small boat with friends on a holiday trip of discovery. But even if all these ideas are wrong, you cannot deny the great good I may do for everyone by finding a passage near the pole to countries that now take many months to reach. Or I may discover the secret of the magnet, which, if it can be discovered at all, can only be discovered through an undertaking like mine.

These thoughts have calmed me, and I feel warm enthusiasm in my heart. Nothing makes the mind so peaceful as having a clear purpose—something the soul can focus on. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.

I have read with great interest the stories of the many voyages that tried to reach the North Pacific Ocean through the seas around the pole. You may remember that our good Uncle Thomas’s library was filled with books about voyages of discovery. My education was neglected, but I loved reading. Those books were my study day and night. They also made me feel more regret, because my father’s last wish stopped my uncle from letting me live the life of a sailor.

These dreams became weaker when I first read the poets whose writing delighted me and seemed to lift me up. I also became a poet, and for one year I lived in a world of my own imagination. I thought I might one day be honoured like Homer and Shakespeare. You know how I failed, and how painful that was for me. But just then I inherited my cousin’s fortune, and my thoughts returned to my earlier dream.

Six years have passed since I decided on my present plan. Even now, I remember the exact hour when I gave myself to this great enterprise. I began by training my body to endure hardship. I travelled with whale-fishers on several journeys to the North Sea. I willingly suffered cold, hunger, thirst, and lack of sleep. I often worked harder than ordinary sailors during the day, and at night I studied mathematics, medicine, and the areas of physical science that could be most useful to a man who travels by sea.

Twice I even hired myself as an under-mate on a Greenland whaling ship, and I did my work so well that people admired me. I admit I felt proud when my captain offered me the second position on the ship and asked me to stay, because he valued my service so highly.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to achieve something great? I could have lived in comfort and luxury, but I chose glory instead of everything money could offer. Oh, if only someone would encourage me and say yes! My courage and determination are strong, but my hopes rise and fall, and I often feel low. I am going to begin a long and difficult voyage, and its dangers will demand all my strength. I must not only keep up the spirits of others, but sometimes also support my own when theirs become weak.

This is the best time for travelling in Russia. People move quickly over the snow in sledges. The motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, much better than travelling in an English stagecoach. The cold is not too great if you are wrapped in furs—clothes I have already started wearing—because there is a big difference between walking on a ship’s deck and sitting still for hours, when no exercise stops your blood from feeling as if it is freezing. I do not want to lose my life on the road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I will leave for that town in two or three weeks, and I plan to hire a ship there. This can easily be done by paying the owner’s insurance. I will also hire as many sailors as I think necessary from among those used to whale-fishing. I do not plan to sail until June; and when will I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer that? If I succeed, many months—perhaps years—will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. May Heaven bless you, and protect me, so that I can again and again show my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
