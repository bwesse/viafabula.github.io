Letter 1

_To Mrs. Saville, England._

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--.

You will be glad to hear that no disaster has marked the beginning of my expedition, though you feared it might. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure you, my dear sister, that I am safe and increasingly confident that my undertaking will succeed.

I am already far north of London, and when I walk through the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern wind on my face that strengthens me and fills me with delight. Do you know that sensation? This wind has traveled from the regions toward which I am moving, and it gives me a first taste of those icy climates. Encouraged by this promising breeze, my daydreams grow more vivid. I try in vain to think of the pole as only a place of frost and desolation; in my imagination it appears instead as a region of beauty and pleasure. There, Margaret, the sun seems forever visible, only skimming the horizon and spreading an endless brightness. And there, if I may trust the reports of earlier navigators, snow and frost may be less dominant than we suppose. Sailing over a calm sea, we might be carried to a land more wonderful and more beautiful than any yet discovered on the inhabited globe. Its natural forms may be unlike anything we know, and the heavens above it may display extraordinary phenomena. What might not be expected in a country of perpetual light? I may discover the mysterious force that draws the needle and perhaps correct many celestial observations that now appear irregular. I shall satisfy my intense curiosity by seeing a part of the world never before visited and perhaps stepping on ground never touched by human feet. These hopes are enough to overcome all fear of danger or death and to make me begin this laborious voyage with the joy of a child setting out in a small boat on an exploring trip. But even if all these ideas prove false, you cannot deny the immense benefit I may confer on mankind by finding a northern passage to distant countries, or by discovering the secret of magnetism, if it can be discovered at all.

These reflections have removed the agitation with which I began this letter, and I now feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm that lifts me up, for nothing calms the mind so much as a fixed purpose, a point on which the soul can rest its thoughts. This expedition has been the favorite dream of my youth. I have read eagerly the accounts of voyages undertaken in the hope of reaching the North Pacific through the seas surrounding the pole. You may remember that our good Uncle Thomas's library consisted almost entirely of histories of voyages of discovery. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. Those volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them only deepened the regret I felt when I learned, as a child, that my father's dying command had forbidden my uncle to let me enter a seafaring life.

These visions faded when I first read those poets whose writings enchanted my soul and seemed to raise it to heaven. I too became a poet, and for one year I lived in a paradise of my own making. I imagined that I might also earn a place among the honored names of Homer and Shakespeare. You know how completely I failed, and how heavily I suffered from that disappointment. But at that very time I inherited my cousin's fortune, and my thoughts returned to the course they had followed before.

Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. Even now I can remember the hour in which I devoted myself to this great enterprise. I began by training my body to endure hardship. I joined whaling crews on several expeditions to the North Sea. I willingly endured cold, hunger, thirst, and lack of sleep. I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and gave my nights to studying mathematics, medical theory, and branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might gain the greatest practical benefit. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate on a Greenland whaler, and I carried out my duties so well that I won admiration. I admit I felt some pride when my captain offered me the second position on the ship and urged me strongly to remain, because he considered my services so valuable.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might have passed in comfort and luxury, but I chose glory over every temptation that wealth placed before me. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer yes. My courage and resolution are firm, but my hopes rise and fall, and my spirits are often low. I am about to undertake a long and difficult voyage whose emergencies will require all my strength of character. I must not only raise the spirits of others, but at times sustain my own when theirs begin to fail.

This is the most favorable season for travel in Russia. People move quickly across the snow in their sledges, and the motion is pleasant, indeed far more agreeable, in my opinion, than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive if one is wrapped in furs, which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and sitting motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from seeming to freeze in the veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks, and I intend to hire a ship there, which can easily be arranged by paying the owner's insurance. I will then engage as many sailors as I think necessary from among men accustomed to whale-fishing. I do not mean to sail until June. And when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer that? If I succeed, many months, perhaps years, will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear and excellent Margaret. May Heaven shower blessings on you, and preserve me, so that I may again and again prove my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
