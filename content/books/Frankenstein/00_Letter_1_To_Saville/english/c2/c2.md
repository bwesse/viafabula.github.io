Letter 1

_To Mrs. Saville, England._

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--.

You will be glad, I think, to hear that no ill fortune has attended the opening of the expedition which you contemplated with such grave apprehension. I reached this place yesterday, and my first duty is to reassure my dear sister both of my safety and of the strengthening confidence with which I now regard the success of my undertaking.

I am already far north of London; and as I move through the streets of Petersburgh, the keen northern air upon my face seems at once to brace and exhilarate me. Do you know that feeling? The wind comes, as it were, from the very quarter toward which I am advancing, and carries with it a foretaste of those icy regions. Under this breath of promise, my daydreams rise with renewed fervor and distinctness. I try, but cannot truly believe, that the pole is nothing more than a kingdom of frost and desolation; it persists in presenting itself to my imagination as a domain of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun appears as though perpetually visible, its broad disk only skirting the horizon while diffusing an unceasing splendor. There also, if I may credit earlier navigators, snow and frost may lose their tyranny; and across a calm sea we may be borne to a land surpassing in wonder and beauty every region yet discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and physical features may prove singular beyond example, as the celestial phenomena above those unknown solitudes may well be. What might not be hoped for in a country of eternal light? I may discover the hidden power that governs the needle, and perhaps bring into harmony innumerable celestial observations whose seeming irregularities await only this voyage for their explanation. I shall at last appease my ardent curiosity by beholding a part of the earth no human eye has seen, and perhaps treading soil never yet marked by the foot of man. These prospects tempt me sufficiently to overcome every fear of danger or death, and to make me enter upon this laborious voyage with something of a child's delight in setting out upon an expedition of discovery. But even should these conjectures prove entirely false, you still cannot deny the incalculable benefit that may be conferred on mankind if I discover a passage near the pole to countries now reached only after many months, or ascertain the secret of magnetism, if indeed that secret is accessible at all.

Such reflections have banished the agitation with which I began this letter, and I feel my heart kindled by an enthusiasm that almost exalts me; for nothing so effectually composes the mind as a settled purpose, some fixed point on which the soul may rest its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the governing dream of my earliest years. I have read with unwearied ardor the narratives of voyages undertaken in the hope of reaching the North Pacific Ocean through the seas that encircle the pole. You may recall that the history of discovery voyages made up nearly the whole of our good Uncle Thomas's library. My education, in the formal sense, was neglected; yet I was passionately attached to reading. Those volumes were my companions day and night, and the intimacy I acquired with them only deepened the regret I felt when, in childhood, I learned that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to permit me to embrace a maritime life.

These visions afterwards receded when I first gave myself to the poets, whose works so entranced my spirit that they seemed to lift it toward heaven. I too became a poet; and for a year I lived in a paradise of my own invention, imagining that I might yet secure some niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are enshrined. You know the extent of my failure, and how heavily the disappointment weighed upon me. Yet it was precisely then that I inherited my cousin's fortune, and with that change my thoughts resumed their former course.

Six years have elapsed since I resolved upon my present enterprise, and even now I can remember the very hour from which I devoted myself to it. I began by disciplining my body to endure privation. I accompanied whalers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily submitted to cold, hunger, thirst, and want of sleep; I frequently worked harder than the common sailors through the day, and devoted the night to mathematics, medical theory, and such branches of physical science as might yield practical advantage to a naval adventurer. Twice I hired myself as an under-mate on board a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself, if I may believe others, with distinction. I confess I felt no small pride when my captain offered me the second station in the vessel and pressed me earnestly to remain, so highly did he value my services.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some considerable purpose? My life might have flowed on in ease and luxury; instead, I chose glory before every allurement that wealth placed in my way. If only some encouraging voice would answer yes. My courage and my resolve are steady, yet my hopes are variable, and my spirits often sink. I stand on the threshold of a long and difficult voyage, whose emergencies will demand all my fortitude: I shall need not only to sustain the spirits of others, but at times to support my own when theirs are failing.

This is the most favorable season for traveling in Russia. They pass rapidly over the snow in sledges; the motion is pleasant and, to my mind, much preferable to that of an English stagecoach. The cold is by no means excessive when one is properly wrapped in furs, a habit I have already adopted; for there is a great difference between pacing the deck and sitting motionless for hours, when no exercise saves the blood from seeming to freeze in one's veins. I have no desire to lose my life upon the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I expect to leave for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks. My intention is to hire a ship there, which may readily be arranged by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I deem necessary from among men accustomed to the whale-fishery. I do not mean to sail before June. And when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how am I to answer? If I succeed, many months, perhaps years, may pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me soon, or else never.

Farewell, my dear and excellent Margaret. May Heaven shower blessings upon you, and preserve me, that I may once more, and often, testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
