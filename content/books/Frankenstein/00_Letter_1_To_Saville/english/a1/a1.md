Letter 1

_To Mrs. Saville, England._

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--.

You will be glad to hear my good news. No disaster has come at the beginning of this journey, even though you feared it might. I arrived here yesterday, and the first thing I must do is tell my dear sister that I am safe and that I feel more confident about success.

I am already far to the north of London. When I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, a cold northern wind touches my face. It makes me feel stronger and fills me with joy. Do you know this feeling? This wind has come from the places where I am traveling, and it gives me a first taste of those icy lands. Because of this promising wind, my dreams grow stronger and brighter. I cannot make myself believe that the pole is only frost and ruin. In my imagination it is a place of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is always seen, just near the horizon, spreading a constant light. And there, if we trust the sailors who went before, snow and frost may be less than we think. Sailing on a calm sea, we may reach a land more wonderful and beautiful than any yet found on earth. Its natural life and its landscape may be unlike anything known. The skies there may also show strange and important wonders. What might we not hope for in a land of endless light? I may discover the force that pulls the compass needle and explain many strange heavenly observations. I will satisfy my strong curiosity by seeing a part of the world no one has visited, and I may step on land where no human foot has stood. These hopes attract me so much that they overcome fear of danger and death. They make me begin this hard voyage with the happiness of a child who starts a small adventure by boat. But even if these ideas are wrong, you cannot deny that my voyage may greatly help mankind by finding a passage near the pole to distant countries, or by learning the secret of magnetism, which can perhaps be found only by an expedition like mine.

These thoughts have taken away the anxiety I felt when I began this letter. Now I feel a warm enthusiasm in my heart, because nothing calms the mind so much as a clear purpose. This expedition has been the favorite dream of my youth. I have eagerly read the stories of voyages made in hope of reaching the North Pacific Ocean through the seas around the pole. You may remember that our good Uncle Thomas had a library made almost entirely of books about voyages of discovery. My education was neglected, but I loved reading passionately. Those books were my study day and night, and knowing them so well increased my regret when I learned, as a child, that my father's dying wish had forbidden my uncle to let me become a sailor.

These dreams became weaker when I first read the poets whose writings enchanted me and lifted my soul. I also became a poet, and for one year I lived in a paradise of my own making. I imagined that I too might win a place among the great names of Homer and Shakespeare. You know my failure and how deeply I felt that disappointment. But just then I inherited my cousin's fortune, and my thoughts returned to their old direction.

Six years have passed since I decided on this present voyage. Even now I remember the exact hour when I gave myself to this great plan. I began by training my body to endure hardship. I went with whale-fishers on several trips to the North Sea. I freely endured cold, hunger, thirst, and little sleep. I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day, and I spent my nights studying mathematics, medical theory, and useful physical science for a naval adventurer. Twice I hired myself as an under-mate on a Greenland whaler, and I performed my duties very well. I admit I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second position on the ship and strongly urged me to stay because he valued my services so highly.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to achieve some great purpose? I could have lived in comfort and luxury, but I chose glory over every attraction of wealth. Oh, if only some encouraging voice would say yes. My courage and resolution are firm, but my hopes rise and fall, and I am often depressed. I am about to go on a long and difficult voyage, and its dangers will require all my strength. I must not only keep up the spirits of others, but sometimes support my own when theirs fail.

This is the best time for traveling in Russia. People move quickly over the snow in sledges, and the motion is pleasant. In my opinion, it is much more agreeable than an English stagecoach. The cold is not too great if you are wrapped in furs, which I have already begun to wear. There is a great difference between walking on a ship's deck and sitting still for hours, when no movement keeps the blood warm. I have no wish to lose my life on the road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I shall leave for that town in two or three weeks. My plan is to hire a ship there, which can be done easily if I pay the insurance for the owner, and then engage as many sailors as I need from men used to whale-fishing. I do not plan to sail until June. And when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer that? If I succeed, many months, perhaps years, will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear and excellent Margaret. May Heaven send blessings on you, and keep me safe, so that I may again and again show my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
