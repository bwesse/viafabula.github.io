Letter 1

*To Mrs. Saville, England.*

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.

You will be happy to hear that nothing bad has happened at the start of my journey. You were worried about it. I arrived here yesterday. My first job is to tell my dear sister that I am safe. I also feel more sure that my plan will work.

I am already far north of London. When I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold wind on my face. It makes me feel strong and happy. Do you know this feeling? This wind comes from the places I am going to. It gives me a first taste of the cold lands. Because of this good wind, my dreams about the journey become stronger and clearer.

I try, but I cannot believe the pole is only ice and emptiness. In my mind it looks like a place of beauty and joy. There, Margaret, the sun is always in the sky. It stays near the edge of the world and gives light all the time. There—and with your permission, my sister, I will believe the sailors from before—there is no snow and no frost. If we sail on a calm sea, we may reach a land more wonderful and more beautiful than any place people have found so far.

The plants and the land there may be very different. The sky and the stars may also look new in those unknown places. What might we find in a land with light all the time? I may find the strange power that pulls the compass needle. I may also help explain many sky observations that seem strange now. I will satisfy my strong curiosity by seeing a part of the world no one has visited before. I may walk on land where no human has ever walked.

These hopes make me want to go. They are strong enough to remove my fear of danger or death. They make me start this hard journey with the joy of a child in a small boat with friends, going to discover something new. But even if these ideas are wrong, you cannot deny the good I may do. I may find a way near the pole to reach countries faster, because now it takes many months. Or I may find the secret of the magnet. If it can be found, it can only be found by a journey like mine.

These thoughts make me calmer. I feel warm excitement in my heart. Nothing makes the mind peaceful like having a clear purpose—something the soul can focus on. This journey has been my favourite dream since I was young.

I have read with great interest the stories of many voyages. They tried to reach the North Pacific Ocean through the seas around the pole. You may remember that our good Uncle Thomas’s library was full of books about voyages of discovery. My education was neglected, but I loved reading. Those books were my study day and night. They also made me feel more sad, because my father’s last wish stopped my uncle from letting me become a sailor.

These dreams became weaker when I first read poets. Their writing made me very happy and lifted my spirit. I also became a poet, and for one year I lived in a world I created. I thought I might one day be honoured like Homer and Shakespeare. You know I failed, and you know how badly I felt. But just then I inherited my cousin’s fortune. My thoughts went back to my earlier dream.

Six years have passed since I decided on my plan. Even now, I remember the exact hour when I gave myself to this great work. I began by training my body to endure hard things. I travelled with whale-fishers on several journeys to the North Sea. I accepted cold, hunger, thirst, and little sleep. I often worked harder than common sailors during the day. At night I studied mathematics, medicine, and science that could help a sea traveller.

Twice I even worked as an under-mate on a Greenland whaling ship. I did my work so well that people admired me. I admit I felt proud when my captain offered me the second position in the ship. He asked me strongly to stay, because he valued my service.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to do something great? I could have lived an easy and rich life, but I chose glory instead of what money could give. Oh, if only someone would say yes and encourage me! My courage and determination are strong, but my hopes go up and down, and I often feel low. I am going to begin a long and difficult journey. Its dangers will need all my strength. I must not only keep others brave, but sometimes also keep myself strong when they become weak.

This is the best time to travel in Russia. People move quickly over snow in sledges. The motion is pleasant. I think it is better than an English stagecoach. The cold is not too strong if you wear furs. I already do this. There is a big difference between walking on a ship’s deck and sitting still for hours, when no exercise stops your blood from feeling like it is freezing. I do not want to die on the road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I will leave for Archangel in two or three weeks. I plan to hire a ship there. This can be done easily by paying the owner’s insurance. I will also hire as many sailors as I think necessary from those used to whale-fishing. I do not plan to sail until June. And when will I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer? If I succeed, many months—perhaps years—will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. May Heaven bless you and protect me, so that I can again and again show my thanks for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
