Letter 1

*To Mrs. Saville, England.*

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.

You will be pleased to hear that no misfortune has attended the beginning of an enterprise you have viewed with such anxious forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first duty is to assure my dear sister of my safety and of my growing confidence in the success of my undertaking.

I am already far north of London, and as I walk through the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a sharp northern breeze on my cheeks that strengthens my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This wind, coming from the very regions toward which I am advancing, gives me a first taste of those icy climates. Encouraged by this promising breath of air, my daydreams become more vivid and intense.

I try in vain to convince myself that the pole is only a place of frost and desolation; it always appears to my imagination as a region of beauty and pleasure. There, Margaret, the sun is said to remain always visible, its broad disk just skimming the horizon and spreading an unbroken splendour. There—for with your permission, my sister, I will place some trust in earlier navigators—snow and frost are believed to be banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be carried to a land surpassing in wonders and beauty every region yet discovered on the habitable globe.

Its productions and features may be entirely unlike anything known, just as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What might not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the mysterious power that attracts the needle, and I may be able to correct a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to make their apparent irregularities consistent for ever. I shall satisfy my ardent curiosity by seeing a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before marked by the foot of man.

These are the attractions that draw me on, and they are enough to overcome all fear of danger or death and to make me begin this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he sets off in a small boat with his companions on a holiday expedition of discovery up his native river. Yet even if all these hopes should prove false, you cannot deny the great benefit I may confer on mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries which now require so many months to reach; or by uncovering the secret of the magnet, which, if it can be achieved at all, can only be achieved by an undertaking like mine.

These reflections have calmed the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm that lifts me up, for nothing brings such peace to the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul can fix its gaze. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.

I have read with great eagerness the accounts of the many voyages undertaken in the hope of reaching the North Pacific Ocean through the seas that surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all voyages of discovery made up the whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. Those volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased the regret I felt, as a child, when I learned that my father’s dying wish had forbidden my uncle to let me adopt a sailor’s life.

These visions faded when I first read the poets whose writings delighted my soul and seemed to raise it to heaven. I too became a poet, and for one year lived in a paradise of my own making; I imagined that I might gain a place in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are honoured. You know well my failure, and how deeply I felt the disappointment. But just then I inherited my cousin’s fortune, and my thoughts returned to their earlier direction.

Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. Even now, I can remember the very hour when I devoted myself to this great enterprise. I began by training my body to endure hardship. I joined the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I willingly endured cold, hunger, thirst, and sleeplessness; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might gain the greatest practical advantage.

Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and I performed my duties to the admiration of all. I admit I felt some pride when my captain offered me the second position in the ship and begged me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might have been spent in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every temptation that wealth could offer. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer yes! My courage and resolve are firm; yet my hopes waver, and my spirits are often low. I am about to set out on a long and difficult voyage, whose demands will require all my strength: I must not only raise the spirits of others, but at times sustain my own when theirs begin to fail.

This is the most favourable time for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my view, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive if you are well wrapped in furs—a clothing I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated and motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from seeming to freeze in your veins. I have no wish to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks, and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the owner’s insurance, and to engage as many sailors as I judge necessary among those accustomed to whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer that? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet again. If I fail, you will see me again soon—or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. May Heaven shower blessings on you, and preserve me, so that I may again and again prove my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
