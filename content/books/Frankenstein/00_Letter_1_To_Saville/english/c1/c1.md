Letter 1

_To Mrs. Saville, England._

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--.

You will rejoice to learn that no calamity has attended the commencement of the expedition you regarded with such ominous anxiety. I arrived here yesterday, and my first obligation is to assure my dear sister of my safety and of my growing confidence in the success of what I have undertaken.

I am already far to the north of London, and while walking through the streets of Petersburgh I feel a cold northern wind against my face that braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you know that sensation? The breeze has traveled from the very regions toward which I advance, and it gives me a foretaste of those icy climates. Inspired by this wind of promise, my visions become more fervent and more distinct. I cannot persuade myself that the pole is merely the domain of frost and desolation; to my imagination it presents itself as a region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun may remain perpetually visible, its broad disk grazing the horizon and diffusing continual splendor. There too, if I may place some trust in earlier navigators, snow and frost may be banished; and across a tranquil sea we may be borne to a land surpassing every known region in wonder and in beauty. Its productions and features may be wholly without precedent, just as the phenomena of the heavens in those undiscovered solitudes may differ from anything yet observed. What might not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may discover the mysterious force that draws the needle, and perhaps reconcile celestial observations whose apparent eccentricities await only such a voyage to be understood. I shall satisfy my ardent curiosity by beholding a part of the world never before visited, and perhaps tread ground never yet impressed by human footsteps. Such prospects suffice to conquer every fear of danger or death and lead me into this laborious voyage with the joy of a child setting out on a holiday expedition of discovery. Yet even if all these conjectures prove unfounded, you cannot dispute the inestimable benefit I may confer upon mankind by discovering a northern passage to countries now reached only after many months, or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, if indeed it is possible to do so by any means.

These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began this letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm that elevates me; for nothing so thoroughly tranquilizes the mind as a steady purpose, a fixed point upon which the soul may rest its intellectual gaze. This expedition has been the favorite dream of my earliest years. I have read with ardor the accounts of voyages undertaken in the hope of reaching the North Pacific Ocean through the seas that encircle the pole. You may remember that the history of voyages of discovery constituted nearly the whole of our good Uncle Thomas's library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately devoted to reading. Those volumes were my constant study, and my intimacy with them intensified the regret I felt when, as a child, I learned that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to permit me a seafaring life.

Those visions faded when I first read the poets whose works entranced my soul and seemed to lift it heavenward. I too became a poet, and for one year I lived in a paradise of my own creation. I imagined I might secure a place in that temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You know my failure, and how heavily I bore the disappointment. Yet at precisely that moment I inherited my cousin's fortune, and my thoughts were redirected into their earlier course.

Six years have passed since I resolved upon my present undertaking. Even now I can recall the very hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I began by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied whalers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I willingly endured cold, hunger, thirst, and want of sleep; I often labored harder than the common sailors by day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, medical theory, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I hired myself as an under-mate aboard a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself, I am told, to admiration. I confess I felt a measure of pride when my captain offered me the second place in the vessel and urged me with great earnestness to remain, so highly did he value my services.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to achieve some great purpose? I might have passed my life in ease and luxury, yet I preferred glory to every enticement wealth placed in my path. Would that some encouraging voice answered yes. My courage and resolve are firm, but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude. I must be ready not only to raise the spirits of others, but at times to sustain my own when theirs fail.

This is the most favorable season for traveling in Russia. They fly swiftly over the snow in sledges; the motion is pleasant and, in my judgment, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive if one is wrapped in furs, a dress I have already adopted, for there is a marked difference between pacing a deck and sitting motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from seeming to freeze in one's veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks, and I intend to hire a ship there, which may easily be arranged by paying the owner's insurance, and to engage as many sailors as I deem necessary from among men accustomed to whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until June. And when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer that question? If I succeed, many months, perhaps years, will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear and excellent Margaret. May Heaven shower blessings upon you, and preserve me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
