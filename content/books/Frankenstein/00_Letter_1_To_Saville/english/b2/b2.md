Letter 1

_To Mrs. Saville, England._

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--.

You will be relieved to hear that no misfortune has attended the opening of the expedition you viewed with such dark forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first duty is to assure my dear sister that I am well and growing more confident in the success of my enterprise.

I am already far north of London, and as I walk through the streets of Petersburgh, the cold northern wind on my face strengthens my nerves and fills me with exhilaration. Do you know the feeling? This wind has traveled from the very regions toward which I am advancing, and it gives me a foretaste of those icy climates. Animated by this wind of promise, my imaginings become more vivid and more ardent. I cannot persuade myself that the pole is merely a seat of frost and desolation; in my mind it appears as a region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun may remain forever visible, skimming the horizon and shedding an unbroken splendor. There too, if one grants some credit to former navigators, snow and frost may be diminished; and over a calm sea we may be carried to a land surpassing every region yet discovered in wonder and beauty. Its productions and features may have no parallel, just as the heavens in those unknown solitudes may reveal phenomena unlike any we have observed. What may not be hoped for in a country of perpetual light? I may discover the mysterious force that governs the needle and resolve celestial observations that now appear inconsistent. I shall satisfy my eager curiosity by seeing a part of the world never before visited, perhaps by setting foot where no human being has trod. These prospects are enough to overcome all fear of danger or death and to send me into this arduous voyage with the delight of a child launching a little boat on a holiday expedition of discovery. And even if these expectations prove mistaken, you cannot deny the lasting benefit I may confer on mankind by finding a passage near the pole to countries that now require months to reach, or by uncovering the secret of magnetism, if indeed such knowledge can be won only by an undertaking like mine.

These reflections have dispelled the uneasiness with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart warm with an enthusiasm that lifts me, for nothing tranquilizes the mind so completely as a settled purpose, a point on which the soul may fix its inward eye. This expedition has been the cherished dream of my earliest years. I have read eagerly the narratives of voyages made in hopes of reaching the North Pacific Ocean through the seas that surround the pole. You may remember that the history of discovery voyages formed nearly the whole of our good Uncle Thomas's library. My formal education was neglected, yet I was passionately devoted to reading. Those volumes were my study by day and night, and my familiarity with them deepened the regret I felt when, as a child, I learned that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to let me pursue a life at sea.

Those early visions faded when I first read the poets whose works enchanted me and seemed to raise my soul heavenward. I too became a poet, and for one year I lived in a paradise of my own invention. I imagined I might earn a place in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are enshrined. You know how fully I failed, and how bitterly I felt that disappointment. Yet at that very moment I inherited my cousin's fortune, and my thoughts returned to their former channel.

Six years have passed since I resolved upon my present undertaking. Even now I can recall the very hour in which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I began by hardening my body against privation. I accompanied whalers on several voyages to the North Sea; I willingly endured cold, hunger, thirst, and sleeplessness; I often labored harder than the common sailors by day and spent my nights studying mathematics, medical theory, and branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might draw real practical advantage. Twice I hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler and acquitted myself, I am told, to admiration. I confess I felt some pride when my captain offered me the second rank in the vessel and urged me earnestly to remain, considering my services of such value.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some worthy purpose? I might have spent my life in ease and luxury, yet I chose glory over every temptation wealth placed before me. If only some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative. My courage and resolution are firm, but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits often sink. I am on the point of a long and difficult voyage, whose emergencies will demand all my fortitude. I must be prepared not only to raise the spirits of others, but at times to sustain my own when theirs are failing.

This is the most favorable season for travel in Russia. They move swiftly over the snow in sledges, and the motion is pleasant, much more agreeable, in my judgment, than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not severe if one is well wrapped in furs, a dress I have already adopted; for there is a great difference between pacing a ship's deck and sitting motionless for hours, when no exercise keeps the blood from seeming to freeze in one's veins. I have no wish to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I shall leave for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks. My intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance on the owner's behalf, and to engage as many sailors as I judge necessary from among men accustomed to whaling. I do not intend to sail before June. And when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer? If I succeed, many months, perhaps years, will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. May Heaven pour its blessings upon you, and preserve me, so that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
