Letter 1

*To Mrs. Saville, England.*

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.

You will be happy to hear that nothing bad has happened at the start of the journey you have worried about so much. I arrived here yesterday, and the first thing I want to do is tell my dear sister that I am safe and that I feel more and more confident about succeeding.

I am already far north of London, and when I walk through the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern wind on my face. It gives me energy and makes me feel excited. Do you know this feeling? This wind has come from the places I am travelling toward, and it gives me an early sense of those icy lands. With this hopeful wind, my daydreams become stronger and clearer.

I cannot make myself believe that the pole is only a place of ice and emptiness; in my imagination it seems like a place of beauty and joy. There, Margaret, the sun is always visible, its wide circle close to the horizon and shining all the time. There—and with your permission, my sister, I will trust what earlier sailors have said—snow and frost do not exist; and, sailing on a calm sea, we may be carried to a land more wonderful and more beautiful than any place discovered so far on the earth.

Its plants and landscapes may be completely different from anything we know, just as the stars and skies in those unknown areas must be different too. What could we not expect in a land of constant light? I may discover the strange power that pulls the compass needle, and I may correct many observations of the sky that only this voyage can explain. I will satisfy my strong curiosity by seeing a part of the world no one has seen before, and I may walk on land where no human foot has ever stepped.

These hopes attract me strongly, and they are enough to make me forget fear of danger or death and to begin this hard voyage with the happiness a child feels when he gets into a small boat with friends on a holiday trip of discovery. But even if all these ideas are wrong, you cannot deny the great good I may do for all people by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries that now take so many months to reach; or by finding the secret of the magnet, which, if it can be found at all, can only be found through an undertaking like mine.

Thinking about these things has calmed me, and I feel a warm enthusiasm in my heart, because nothing makes the mind so peaceful as a clear goal—a point the soul can keep its attention on. This journey has been the favourite dream of my early life.

I have read with great interest the stories of the many voyages that tried to reach the North Pacific Ocean through the seas around the pole. You may remember that our good Uncle Thomas’s library was made up entirely of books about voyages of discovery. My education was neglected, but I loved reading. Those books were my study day and night, and they made me feel even more regret when I remembered that my father’s last wish had stopped my uncle from letting me live a sailor’s life.

These dreams became weaker when I first read the poets whose writing delighted me and seemed to lift me toward heaven. I also became a poet, and for one year I lived in a world of my own imagination; I thought I might one day be honoured like Homer and Shakespeare. You know how I failed, and how painful that disappointment was for me. But at that time I inherited my cousin’s fortune, and my thoughts returned to their earlier direction.

Six years have passed since I decided on my present plan. Even now, I remember the exact hour when I devoted myself to this great enterprise. I began by training my body to endure hardship. I travelled with whale-fishers on several journeys to the North Sea; I willingly suffered cold, hunger, thirst, and lack of sleep. I often worked harder than the ordinary sailors during the day and spent my nights studying mathematics, medicine, and the parts of physical science that could be most useful to someone who travels by sea.

Twice I even hired myself as an under-mate on a Greenland whaling ship, and I did my work so well that people admired me. I admit I felt proud when my captain offered me the second position on the ship and asked me to stay, because he valued my work so highly.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to achieve something great? I could have lived in comfort and luxury, but I chose glory instead of everything money could offer. Oh, if only some encouraging voice would say yes! My courage and determination are strong, but my hopes rise and fall, and I often feel low. I am going to begin a long and difficult voyage, and its dangers will require all my strength. I must not only keep up the spirits of others, but sometimes also support my own when theirs grow weak.

This is the best time of year to travel in Russia. People move quickly over the snow in sledges; the movement is pleasant, and, in my opinion, much more comfortable than travelling in an English stagecoach. The cold is not too great if you are wrapped in furs—clothes I have already started wearing—because there is a big difference between walking on a ship’s deck and sitting still for hours, when no exercise stops your blood from feeling as if it is freezing. I do not want to lose my life on the road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I will leave for that town in two or three weeks, and I plan to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the owner’s insurance. I will also hire as many sailors as I think necessary from among those used to whale-fishing. I do not plan to sail until June; and when will I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer that? If I succeed, many months—perhaps years—will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. May Heaven bless you, and protect me, so that I can again and again show my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
