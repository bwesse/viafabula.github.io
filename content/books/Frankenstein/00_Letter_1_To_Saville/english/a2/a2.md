Letter 1

_To Mrs. Saville, England._

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--.

You will be happy to hear that the journey has begun without any disaster, although you feared the worst. I arrived here yesterday, and my first duty is to tell you, my dear sister, that I am well and becoming more confident that my plan will succeed.

I am already far north of London, and when I walk through the streets of Petersburgh, a cold northern wind blows on my face. It strengthens me and gives me real pleasure. Do you know that feeling? This wind has come from the regions I am traveling toward, and it gives me a first taste of those icy places. Encouraged by this wind of promise, my dreams become more intense and clearer. I try, but cannot truly believe that the pole is only a place of frost and desolation. In my imagination, it appears as a region of beauty and joy. There, Margaret, the sun is always visible, with its wide disk near the horizon, spreading constant light. And there, if I may trust earlier navigators, snow and frost may be driven away. Sailing over a calm sea, we may be carried to a land more wonderful and beautiful than any yet discovered on the inhabited earth. Its plants, animals, and physical features may be unlike anything known elsewhere, just as the stars may show strange phenomena in those unknown places. What may be discovered in a country of eternal light? I may find the mysterious force that attracts the compass needle, and I may correct many celestial observations that now seem irregular. I shall satisfy my strong curiosity by seeing a part of the world no one has visited before, and perhaps walk on land where no human foot has yet stepped. These hopes attract me so strongly that they overcome my fear of danger or death and make me begin this difficult voyage with the joy of a child starting a small discovery trip. But even if all these ideas prove false, you still cannot deny the great benefit I may give to mankind by finding a polar passage to distant countries, or by discovering the secret of magnetism, if that is possible at all.

These reflections have removed the anxiety with which I began my letter, and now I feel my heart glowing with enthusiasm. Nothing calms the mind so much as a steady purpose, something on which the soul can fix itself. This expedition has been the favorite dream of my early life. I have read eagerly the accounts of many voyages made in the hope of reaching the North Pacific Ocean through the seas around the pole. You may remember that the history of discovery voyages filled almost all of our good Uncle Thomas's library. My education was neglected, yet I loved reading passionately. Those books were my constant study, and knowing them so well increased the regret I felt when I learned, as a child, that my father's dying command had prevented my uncle from letting me go to sea.

These dreams faded when I first read poets whose works enchanted me and lifted my soul. I also became a poet, and for one year I lived in a paradise of my own imagination. I believed that I too might win a place among the great names of Homer and Shakespeare. You know how I failed, and how deeply I suffered from that disappointment. But at that very time I inherited my cousin's fortune, and my thoughts turned back to their former direction.

Six years have passed since I decided on my present undertaking. Even now, I can remember the hour when I devoted myself to this great enterprise. I began by training my body to endure hardship. I joined whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea. I willingly faced cold, hunger, thirst, and lack of sleep. I often worked harder than ordinary sailors during the day, and spent my nights studying mathematics, medical theory, and branches of physical science that could be useful to a naval adventurer. Twice I hired myself as an under-mate on a Greenland whaler, and I performed so well that I earned admiration. I admit I felt some pride when my captain offered me the second rank on the ship and earnestly asked me to remain because he considered my services so valuable.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish something great? I might have spent my life in comfort and luxury, but I chose glory over every temptation that wealth placed before me. Oh, if only some encouraging voice would answer yes. My courage and determination are firm, but my hopes change often, and my spirits are sometimes low. I am about to begin a long and difficult voyage, and its many dangers will require all my strength of mind. I must not only encourage others, but sometimes support myself when their courage fails.

This is the best season for traveling in Russia. People move quickly over the snow in sledges, and the motion is pleasant, much more agreeable, in my opinion, than riding in an English stagecoach. The cold is not too severe if one is wrapped in furs, which I have already begun to wear. There is a great difference between walking on deck and sitting still for hours without exercise, when the blood seems ready to freeze in one's veins. I have no desire to lose my life on the road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I shall leave for that town in a fortnight or three weeks. My plan is to hire a ship there, which can be done easily by paying the owner's insurance, and to engage as many sailors as I find necessary from men accustomed to whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until June. And when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer? If I succeed, many months, perhaps even years, will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear and excellent Margaret. May Heaven shower blessings upon you, and protect me, so that I may again and again express my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
