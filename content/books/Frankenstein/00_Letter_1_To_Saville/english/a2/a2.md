Letter 1

*To Mrs. Saville, England.*

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.

You will be happy to hear that nothing bad has happened as I begin the journey you were so worried about. I arrived here yesterday, and my first job is to tell you, my dear sister, that I am well and that I feel more confident about my plan.

I am already far north of London. When I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold wind on my face. It gives me energy and makes me feel excited. Do you know this feeling? This wind has come from the places I am going to, so it feels like a first sign of the icy lands ahead. Because of this hopeful wind, my dreams about the journey become stronger and clearer.

I try, but I cannot believe that the pole is only a place of ice and emptiness. In my imagination it looks like a place of beauty and joy. There, Margaret, the sun is always visible. It stays close to the horizon and gives light all the time. There—and with your permission, my sister, I will believe the earlier sailors—snow and frost are not there. If we sail on a calm sea, we may reach a land that is more wonderful and more beautiful than any place people have discovered so far.

Its plants and landscapes may be very different from anything we know. The sky and the stars may also be different in those unknown places. What could we not find in a land of постоян light? I may discover the strange power that pulls the compass needle. I may also make many observations of the sky clearer, because only this voyage can explain things that seem strange now. I will satisfy my strong curiosity by seeing a part of the world no one has visited before, and I may walk on land where no human has ever walked.

These hopes pull me forward. They are strong enough to take away my fear of danger or death, and they make me start this hard voyage with the joy of a child who goes in a small boat with friends on a holiday adventure. But even if all these ideas are wrong, you cannot deny the great good I may do by finding a passage near the pole to countries that now take many months to reach. Or I may discover the secret of the magnet, which, if it can be discovered at all, can only be discovered by a journey like mine.

These thoughts have calmed me, and I feel warm excitement in my heart. Nothing makes the mind so peaceful as having a clear purpose—something the soul can focus on. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.

I have read with great interest the stories of many voyages that tried to reach the North Pacific Ocean through the seas around the pole. You may remember that our good Uncle Thomas’s library was full of books about voyages of discovery. My education was neglected, but I loved reading. Those books were my study day and night. They also made me more sad, because my father’s last wish stopped my uncle from letting me become a sailor.

These dreams became weaker when I first read the poets whose writing delighted me and seemed to lift me up. I also became a poet, and for one year I lived in a world of my own imagination. I thought I might one day be honoured like Homer and Shakespeare. You know how I failed, and how painful that was for me. But just then I inherited my cousin’s fortune, and my thoughts returned to my earlier dream.

Six years have passed since I decided on my present plan. Even now, I remember the exact hour when I gave myself to this great work. I began by training my body to endure hardship. I travelled with whale-fishers on several journeys to the North Sea. I willingly suffered cold, hunger, thirst, and lack of sleep. I often worked harder than ordinary sailors during the day, and at night I studied mathematics, medicine, and the parts of science that could be most useful to a man who travels by sea.

Twice I even hired myself as an under-mate on a Greenland whaling ship, and I did my work so well that people admired me. I admit I felt proud when my captain offered me the second position on the ship and asked me to stay, because he valued my service so much.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to achieve something great? I could have lived in comfort, but I chose glory instead of everything money could offer. Oh, if only someone would encourage me and say yes! My courage and determination are strong, but my hopes go up and down, and I often feel sad. I am going to begin a long and difficult voyage, and its dangers will need all my strength. I must not only keep up the spirits of others, but sometimes also support my own when theirs become weak.

This is the best time for travelling in Russia. People move quickly over the snow in sledges, and the motion is pleasant—more pleasant, I think, than an English stagecoach. The cold is not too strong if you are wrapped in furs—clothes I have already started wearing—because there is a big difference between walking on a ship’s deck and sitting still for hours, when no exercise stops the blood from feeling as if it is freezing. I do not want to lose my life on the road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I will leave for Archangel in two or three weeks, and I plan to hire a ship there. This can easily be done by paying the owner’s insurance. I will also hire as many sailors as I think necessary from among those used to whale-fishing. I do not plan to sail until June; and when will I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer that? If I succeed, many months—perhaps years—will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. May Heaven bless you, and protect me, so that I can again and again show my gratitude for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
