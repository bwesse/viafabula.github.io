Letter 1

_To Mrs. Saville, England._

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--.

I am happy to tell you good news. Nothing bad happened at the start of my trip. I came here yesterday. First, I want to tell you I am safe and I feel more sure about my plan.

I am far north of London now. When I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, a cold wind touches my face. It makes me feel strong and happy. Do you know this feeling? The wind comes from the cold places where I am going, so it feels like a small taste of that world. This makes my dreams stronger. I cannot believe the North Pole is only ice and emptiness. In my mind it looks beautiful. There, Margaret, the sun always shines near the horizon and gives light all the time. Some sailors say there may be less snow and frost there. Maybe we can sail on a quiet sea to a wonderful land, more beautiful than any land people know now. The plants, animals, and land may be very different. The sky may also show strange things. What can we find in a land of endless light? Maybe I can learn why the compass needle moves, and maybe I can explain many star observations. I want to see a place no one has seen before, and maybe walk where no person has walked. These hopes make me brave. They help me forget danger and death. I start this hard trip with joy, like a child in a small boat on a holiday adventure. And even if I am wrong, my voyage may still help all people. I may find a shorter way near the pole to distant countries, or learn the secret of the magnet. If that secret can be found, a voyage like mine is the way.

These thoughts have made me calm again. When I began this letter, I was worried, but now my heart feels warm and excited. A strong purpose makes the mind peaceful. This journey has been my favorite dream since I was young. I read many books about voyages that tried to reach the North Pacific by sailing in the seas around the pole. You remember Uncle Thomas's library. It was full of books about discovery voyages. My education was not very good, but I loved reading very much. I read those books day and night. They also made me sad, because when I was a child I learned that my father's last wish stopped my uncle from letting me become a sailor.

Later, these dreams changed when I first read great poets. Their poems deeply moved me and lifted my spirit. I became a poet too, and for one year I lived in a world I made in my mind. I thought I might become famous like Homer or Shakespeare. You know I failed, and you know how much that hurt me. But at that time I inherited money from my cousin, and then my thoughts went back to my old dream.

Six years have passed since I decided to do this voyage. I still remember the hour when I gave myself to this great plan. I started by making my body strong for hardship. I went with whale-fishers on trips to the North Sea. I chose to bear cold, hunger, thirst, and little sleep. I often worked harder than the other sailors in the day. At night I studied mathematics, medicine, and useful science for a sea traveler. Twice I worked as an under-mate on a Greenland whaling ship, and I did very well. I admit I felt proud when my captain offered me a higher place on the ship and strongly asked me to stay, because he thought my work was so valuable.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to do something great? I could have lived an easy and rich life, but I chose glory instead of comfort. Oh, I wish someone would say yes. My courage and my decision are strong, but my hopes change, and I am often low in spirit. I am going on a long and hard voyage, and I will need all my strength of mind. I must not only encourage other people, but sometimes encourage myself when they lose heart.

This is the best time to travel in Russia. People move fast over the snow in sledges. It feels pleasant, and I think it is much nicer than riding in an English stagecoach. The cold is not too bad if you wear furs, and I already do that. There is a big difference between walking on a ship's deck and sitting still for many hours. Without movement, your blood can feel as if it is freezing in your veins. I do not want to die on the road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I will leave for Archangel in about two or three weeks. I plan to hire a ship there. This is easy if I pay the owner's insurance. I will also hire as many sailors as I think I need, choosing men used to whale-fishing. I do not plan to sail until June. And when will I come back? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer? If I succeed, many months, maybe years, will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me soon, or never.

Goodbye, my dear and excellent Margaret. May Heaven bless you, and keep me safe, so I can again and again thank you for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
