Letter 1

*To Mrs. Saville, England.*

St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.

You will be happy to know: I am safe. I started the journey you feared. Nothing bad happened. I came here yesterday. My first message is for you, my dear sister. I am well. I feel more sure my plan can work.

I am far north of London. I walk in the streets of Petersburgh. I feel a cold wind on my face. It makes me feel strong and glad. Do you know this feeling? The wind comes from the places I will go to. It is a first sign of the ice lands. This good wind makes my dreams stronger and clearer.

I try, but I cannot think the pole is only ice and emptiness. In my mind it is a place of beauty and joy. There, Margaret, the sun stays in the sky. It is near the edge of the sky and it shines all the time. There—and with your leave, my sister, I believe the old sailors—there is no snow and no frost. On a calm sea, we may reach a land more wonderful and more beautiful than any land people have found before.

The plants and the land there may be new and strange. The sky may also be new and strange in those unknown places. What can we not hope for in a land of always-light? I may find the power that pulls the compass needle. I may help make sky observations clear, because this journey can explain what looks strange now. I will satisfy my strong curiosity. I will see a part of the world no one has seen. I may walk on land where no person has walked.

These hopes pull me forward. They are enough to beat fear of danger or death. They make me start this hard voyage with the joy of a child in a small boat with friends, going to discover something. But even if these hopes are wrong, you cannot deny the good I may do for people. I may find a passage near the pole to those countries that now take many months to reach. Or I may find the secret of the magnet. If it can be found, it can only be found by a voyage like mine.

These thoughts make me calm. My heart feels warm and full. Nothing makes the mind quiet like a clear purpose—one point the soul can look at. This trip has been my favourite dream since I was young.

I have read many stories of voyages. They tried to reach the North Pacific Ocean through the seas around the pole. You may remember Uncle Thomas’ library. It was full of books about discovery voyages. My education was neglected, but I loved reading. These books were my work day and night. They also made me more sad, because my father’s last wish stopped my uncle from letting me live a sailor’s life.

These dreams became weaker when I read poets for the first time. Their words made my soul feel lifted. I became a poet too. For one year I lived in a world I made. I thought I could be great, like Homer and Shakespeare. You know I failed. You know how heavy that felt. But then I inherited my cousin’s fortune, and my thoughts went back to my older dream.

Six years have passed since I chose this plan. Even now I remember the hour I gave myself to this work. I began by training my body to endure hardship. I went with whale-fishers on trips to the North Sea. I chose to endure cold, hunger, thirst, and little sleep. I often worked harder than common sailors in the day. At night I studied maths, medicine, and science that could help a sea adventurer.

Twice I hired myself as an under-mate on a Greenland whaler. I did my work very well. I admit I felt proud when the captain offered me the second place in the ship. He asked me strongly to stay, because he valued my service.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to do something great? I could have lived in ease and luxury, but I chose glory over what money offers. Oh, I wish someone would say “yes” and encourage me! My courage and resolve are strong, but my hopes change, and I often feel low. I will go on a long and difficult voyage. It will need all my strength. I must lift the spirits of others, and sometimes I must also lift my own when theirs fall.

This is a good time to travel in Russia. People move fast over the snow in sledges. The motion is pleasant. I think it is better than an English stagecoach. The cold is not too much if you wear furs. I already wear them. There is a big difference between walking the deck and sitting still for hours, when no movement keeps the blood from feeling frozen. I do not want to lose my life on the road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

I will leave for Archangel in two or three weeks. I plan to hire a ship there. This can be done by paying insurance for the owner. I will hire as many sailors as I think I need, from those used to whale-fishing. I will not sail until June. And when will I return? Dear sister, how can I answer? If I succeed, many months—maybe years—will pass before we meet again. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. May Heaven bless you, and save me, so I can again and again show my thanks for all your love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton
