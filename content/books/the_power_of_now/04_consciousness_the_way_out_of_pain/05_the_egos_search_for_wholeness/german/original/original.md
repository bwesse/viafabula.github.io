# The Ego's Search For Wholeness

THE EGO'S SEARCH FOR WHOLENESS
Another aspect of the emotional pain that is an intrinsic part of the
egoic mind is a deep-seated sense of lack or incompleteness, of not being
whole. In some people, this is conscious, in others unconscious. If it is
conscious, it manifests as the unsettling and constant feeling of not being
worthy or good enough. If it is unconscious, it will only be felt indirectly as
an intense craving, wanting and needing. In either case, people will often
enter into a compulsive pursuit of ego-gratification and things to identify
with in order to fill this hole they feel within. So they strive after
possessions, money, success, power, recognition, or a special relationship,
basically so that they can feel better about themselves, feel more complete.
But even when they attain all these things, they soon find that the hole is
still there, that it is bottomless. Then they are really in trouble, because they
cannot delude themselves anymore. Well, they can and do, but it gets more
difficult.
As long as the egoic mind is running your life, you cannot truly be at
ease; you cannot be at peace or fulfilled except for brief intervals when you
obtained what you wanted, when a craving has just been fulfilled. Since the
ego is a derived sense of self, it needs to identify with external things. It
needs to be both defended and fed constantly. The most common ego
identifications have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status
and recognition, knowledge and education, physical appearance, special
abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief systems, and
often also political, nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective
identifications. None of these is you. Do you find this frightening? Or is it a
relief to know this? All of these things you will have to relinquish sooner or
later. Perhaps you find it as yet hard to believe, and I am certainly not
asking you to believe that your identity cannot be found in any of those
things. You will know the troth of it for yourself. You will know it at the
latest when you feel death approaching. Death is a stripping away of all that
is not you. The secret of life is to “die before you die” and find that there is
no death.
