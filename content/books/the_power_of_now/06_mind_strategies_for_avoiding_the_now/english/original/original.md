# Mind Strategies For Avoiding The Now

MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE
NOW

LOSS OF NOW: THE CORE DELUSION
Even if I completely accept that ultimately time is an illusion, what
difference is that going to make in my life? I still have to live in a world
that is completely dominated by time.
Intellectual agreement is just another belief and won't make much
difference to your life. To realize this truth, you need to live it. When every
cell of your body is so present that it feels vibrant with life, and when you
can feel that life every moment as the joy of Being, then it can be said that
you are free of time.
But I still have to pay the bills tomorrow, and I am still going to grow
old and die just like everybody else. So how can I ever say that I am free of
time?
Tomorrow's bills are not the problem. The dissolution of the physical
body is not a problem. Loss of Now is the problem, or rather: the core
delusion that turns a mere situation, event, or emotion into a personal
problem and into suffering. Loss of Now is loss of Being.
To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of past for
your identity and future for your fulfillment. It represents the most profound
transformation of consciousness that you can imagine. In some rare cases,
this shift in consciousness happens dramatically and radically, once and for
all. When it does, it usually comes about through total surrender in the
midst of intense suffering. Most people, however, have to work at it.
When you have had your first few glimpses of the timeless state of
consciousness, you begin to move back and forth between the dimensions
of time and presence. First you become aware of just how rarely your
attention is truly in the Now. But to know that you are not present is a great
success: that knowing is presence even if initially it only lasts for a couple
of seconds of dock time before it is lost again. Then, with increasing
frequency, you choose to have the focus of your consciousness in the
present moment rather than in the past or future, and whenever you realize
that you had lost the Now, you are able to stay in it not just for a couple of
seconds, but for longer periods as perceived from the external perspective
of dock time. So before you are firmly established in the state of presence,
which is to say before you are fully conscious, you shift back and forth for a

while between consciousness and unconsciousness, between the state of
presence and the state of mind identification. You lose the Now, and you
return to it, again and again. Eventually, presence becomes your
predominant state.
For most people, presence is experienced either never at all or only
accidentally and briefly on rare occasions without being recognized for
what it is. Most humans alternate not between consciousness and
unconsciousness but only between different levels of unconsciousness.

ORDINARY UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND
DEEP UNCONSCIOUSNESS
What do you mean by different levels of unconsciousness? As you
probably know, in sleep you constantly move between the phases of
dreamless sleep and the dream state. Similarly, in wakefulness most people
only shift between ordinary unconsciousness and deep unconsciousness.
What I call ordinary unconsciousness means being identified with your
thought processes and emotions, your reactions, desires, and aversions. It is
most people's normal state. In that state, you are run by the egoic mind, and
you are unaware of Being.
It is a state not of acute pain or unhappiness but of an almost
continuous low level of unease, discontent, boredom, or nervousness a kind
of background static. You may not realize this because it is so much a part
of “normal” living, just as you are not aware of a continuous low
background noise, such as the hum of an air conditioner, until it stops.
When it suddenly does stop, there is a sense of relief. Many people use
alcohol, drugs, sex, food, work, television, or even shopping as anesthetics
in an unconscious attempt to remove the basic unease. When this happens,
an activity that might be very enjoyable if used in moderation becomes
imbued with a compulsive or addictive quality, and all that is ever achieved
through it is extremely short-lived symptom relief.
The unease of ordinary unconsciousness turns into the pain of deep
unconsciousness a state of more acute and more obvious suffering or
unhappiness when things “go wrong,” when the ego is threatened or there is
a major challenge, threat, or loss, real or imagined, in your life situation or
conflict in a relationship. It is an intensified version of ordinary
unconsciousness, different from it not in kind but in degree.
In ordinary unconsciousness, habitual resistance to or denial of what is
creates the unease and discontent that most people accept as normal living.
When this resistance becomes intensified through some challenge or threat
to the ego, it brings up intense negativity such as anger, acute fear,
aggression, depression, and so on. Deep unconsciousness often means that
the pain-body has been triggered and that you have become identified with

it. Physical violence would be impossible without deep unconsciousness. It
can also occur easily whenever and wherever a crowd of people or even an
entire nation generates a negative collective energy field.
The best indicator of your level of consciousness is how you deal with
life's challenges when they come. Through those challenges, an already
unconscious person tends to become more deeply unconscious, and a
conscious person more intensely conscious. You can use a challenge to
awaken you, or you can allow it to pull you into even deeper sleep. The
dream of ordinary unconsciousness then turns into a nightmare.
If you cannot be present even in normal circumstances, such as when
you are sitting alone in a room, walking in the woods, or listening to
someone, then you certainly won't be able to stay conscious when
something “goes wrong” or you are faced with difficult people or situations,
with loss or the threat of loss. You will be taken over by a reaction, which
ultimately is always some form of fear, and pulled into deep
unconsciousness. Those challenges are your tests. Only the way in which
you deal with them will show you and others where you are at as far as your
state of consciousness is concerned, not how long you can sit with your
eyes closed or what visions you see.
So it is essential to bring more consciousness into your life in ordinary
situations when everything is going relatively smoothly. In this way, you
grow in presence power. It generates an energy field in you and around you
of a high vibrational frequency. No unconsciousness, no negativity, no
discord or violence can enter that field and survive, just as darkness cannot
survive in the presence of light.
When you learn to be the witness of your thoughts and emotions,
which is an essential part of being present, you may be surprised when you
first become aware of the background “static” of ordinary unconsciousness
and realize how rarely, if ever, you are truly at ease within yourself. On the
level of your thinking, you will find a great deal of resistance in the form of
judgment, discontent, and mental projection away from the Now. On the
emotional level, there will be an undercurrent of unease, tension, boredom,
or nervousness. Both are aspects of the mind in its habitual resistance mode.

WHAT ARE THEY SEEKING?
Carl Jung tells in one of his books of a conversation he had with a
Native American chief who pointed out to him that in his perception most
white people have tense faces, staring eyes, and a cruel demeanor. He said:
“They are always seeking something. What are they seeking? The whites
always want something. They are always uneasy and restless. We dont
know what they want. We think they are mad.”
The undercurrent of constant unease started long before the rise of
Western industrial civilization, of course, but in Western civilization, which
now covers almost the entire globe, including most of the East, it manifests
in an unprecedentedly acute form. It was already there at the time of Jesus,
and it was there 60o years before that at the time of Buddha, and long
before that. Why are you always anxious? Jesus asked his disciples. “Can
anxious thought add a single day to your life?” And the Buddha taught that
the root of suffering is to be found in our constant wanting and craving.
Resistance to the Now as a collective dysfunction is intrinsically
connected to loss of awareness of Being and forms the basis of our
dehumanized industrial civilization. Freud, by the way, also recognized the
existence of this undercurrent of unease and wrote about it in his book
Civilization and Its Discontents, but he did not recognize the true root of the
unease and failed to realize that freedom from it is possible. This collective
dysfunction has created a very unhappy and extraordinarily violent
civilization that has become a threat not only to itself but also to all life on
the planet.

DISSOLVING ORDINARY
UNCONSCIOUSNESS
So how can we be free of this affliction?
Make it conscious. Observe the many ways in which unease,
discontent, and tension arise within you through unnecessary judgment,
resistance to what is, and denial of the Now. Anything unconscious
dissolves when you shine the light of consciousness on it. Once you know
how to dissolve ordinary unconsciousness, the light of your presence will
shine brightly, and it will be much easier to deal with deep unconsciousness
whenever you feel its gravitational pull. However, ordinary
unconsciousness may not be easy to detect initially because it is so normal.
Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state through self-
observation. 'Am I at ease at this moment?“ is a good question to ask
yourself frequently. Or you can ask: ”Whats going on inside me at this
moment?" Be at least as interested in what goes on inside you as what
happens outside. If you get the inside right, the outside will fall into place.
Primary reality is within, secondary reality without. But dont answer these
questions immediately. Direct your attention inward. Have a look inside
yourself. What kind of thoughts is your mind producing? What do you feel?
Direct your attention into the body. Is there any tension? Once you detect
that there is a low level of unease, the background static, see in what way
you are avoiding, resisting, or denying life by denying the Now. There are
many ways in which people unconsciously resist the present moment. I will
give you a few examples. With practice, your power of self- observation, of
monitoring your inner state, will become sharpened.

FREEDOM FROM UNHAPPINESS
Do you resent doing what you are doing? It may be your job, or you
may have agreed to do something and are doing it, but part of you resents
and resists it. Are you carrying unspoken resentment toward a person close
to you? Do you realize that the energy you thus emanate is so harmful in its
effects that you are in fact contaminating yourself as well as those around
you? Have a good look inside. Is there even the slightest trace of
resentment, unwillingness? If there is, observe it on both the mental and the
emotional levels. What thoughts is your mind creating around this
situation? Then look at the emotion, which is the body's reaction to those
thoughts. Feel the emotion. Does it feel pleasant or unpleasant? Is it an
energy that you would actually choose to have inside you? Do you have a
choice?
Maybe you are being taken advantage of, maybe the activity you are
engaged in is tedious, maybe someone close to you is dishonest, irritating,
or unconscious, but all this is irrelevant. Whether your thoughts and
emotions about this situation are justified or not makes no difference. The
fact is that you are resisting what is. You are making the present moment
into an enemy. You are creating unhappiness, conflict between the inner
and the outer. Your unhappiness is polluting not only your own inner being
and those around you but also the collective human psyche of which you
are an inseparable part. The pollution of the planet is only an outward
reflection of an inner psychic pollution: millions of unconscious individuals
not taking responsibility for their inner space.
Either stop doing what you are doing, speak to the person concerned
and express fully what you feel, or drop the negativity that your mind has
created around the situation and that serves no purpose whatsoever except
to strengthen a false sense of self. Recognizing its futility is important.
Negativity is never the optimum way of dealing with any situation. In fact,
in most cases it keeps you stuck in it, blocking real change. Anything that is
done with negative energy will become contaminated by it and in time give
rise to more pain, more unhappiness. Furthermore, any negative inner state
is contagious: Unhappiness spreads more easily than a physical disease.
Through the law of resonance, it triggers and feeds latent negativity in

others, unless they are immune that is, highly conscious.
Are you polluting the world or cleaning up the mess? You are
responsible for your inner space; nobody else is, just as you are responsible
for the planet. As within, so without: If humans clear inner pollution, then
they will also cease to create outer pollution.
How can we drop negativity, as you suggest?
By dropping it. How do you drop a piece of hot coal that you are
holding in your hand? How do you drop some heavy and useless baggage
that you are carrying? By recognizing that you don't want to suffer the pain
or carry the burden anymore and then letting go of it.
Deep unconsciousness, such as the pain-body, or other deep pain, such
as the loss of a loved one, usually needs to be transmuted through
acceptance combined with the light of your presence your sustained
attention. Many patterns in ordinary unconsciousness, on the other hand,
can simply be dropped once you know that you don't want them and don't
need them anymore, once you realize that you have a choice, that you are
not just a bundle of conditioned reflexes. All this implies that you are able
to access the power of Now. Without it, you have no choice. If you call
some emotions negative, aren't you creating a mental polarity of good and
bad, as you explained earlier?
No. The polarity was created at an earlier stage when your mind
judged the present moment as bad; this judgment then created the negative
emotion.
But if you call some emotions negative, aren't you really saying that
they shouldn't be there, that it's not okay to have those emotions? My
understanding is that we should give ourselves permission to have whatever
feelings come up, rather than judge them as bad or say that we shouldn't
have them. It's okay to feel resentful; it's okay to be angry, irritated, moody,
or whatever otherwise, we get into repression, inner conflict, or denial.
Everything is okay as it is.
Of course. Once a mind pattern, an emotion or a reaction is there,
accept it. You were not conscious enough to have a choice in the matter.
Thats not a judgment, just a fact. If you had a choice, or realized that you
do have a choice, would you choose suffering or joy, ease or unease, peace
or conflict?
Would you choose a thought or feeling that cuts you off from your
natural state of well-being, the joy of life within? Any such feeling I call
negative, which simply means bad. Not in the sense that “You shouldn't
have done that” but just plain factual bad, like feeling sick in the stomach.

How is it possible that humans killed in excess of 100 million fellow
humans in the twentieth century alone? Humans inflicting pain of such
magnitude on one another is beyond anything you can imagine. And thats
not taking into account the mental, emotional and physical violence, the
torture, pain, and cruelty they continue to inflict on each other as well as on
other sentient beings on a daily basis.
Do they act in this way because they are in touch with 87 their natural
state, the joy of life within? Of course not. Only people who are in a deeply
negative state, who feel very bad indeed, would create such a reality as a
reflection of how they feel. Now they are engaged in destroying nature and
the planet that sustains them. Unbelievable but true. Humans are a
dangerously insane and very sick species. Thats not a judgment. Ifs a fact. It
is also a fact that the sanity is there underneath the madness. Healing and
redemption are available right now.
Coming back specifically to what you said it is certainly true that,
when you accept your resentment, moodiness, anger, and so on, you are no
longer forced to act them out blindly, and you are less likely to project them
onto others. But I wonder if you are not deceiving yourself. When you have
been practicing acceptance for a while, as you have,
there comes a point when you need to go on to the next stage, where
those negative emotions are not created anymore. If you don't, your
“acceptance” just becomes a mental label that allows your ego to continue
to indulge in unhappiness and so strengthen its sense of separation from
other people, your surroundings, youre here and now. As you know,
separation is the basis for the ego's sense of identity. True acceptance would
transmute those feelings at once. And if you really knew deeply that
everything is “okay,” as you put it, and which of course is true, then would
you have those negative feelings in the first place? Without judgment,
without resistance to what is, they would not arise. You have an idea in
your mind that “everything is okay,” but deep down you dont really believe
it, and so the old mental- emotional patterns of resistance are still in place.
Thats what makes you feel bad.
Thats okay, too.
Are you defending your right to be unconscious, your right to suffer?
Don't worry: nobody is going to take that away from you. Once you realize
that a certain kind of food makes you sick, would you carry on eating that
food and keep asserting that it is okay to be sick?

WHEREVER YOU ARE, BE THERE
TOTALLY
Can you give some more examples of ordinary unconsciousness?
See if you can catch yourself complaining, in either speech or thought,
about a situation you find yourself in, what other people do or say, your
surroundings, your life situation, even the weather. To complain is always
nonacceptance of what is.
It invariably carries an unconscious negative charge. When you
complain, you make yourself into a victim. When you speak out, you are in
your power. So change the situation by taking action or by speaking out if
necessary or possible; leave the situation or accept it. All else is madness.
Ordinary unconsciousness is always linked in some way with denial of
the Now. The Now, of course, also implies the here. Are you resisting your
here and now? Some people would always rather be somewhere else. Their
“here” is never good enough. Through self-observation, find out if that is
the case in your life. Wherever you are, be there totally. If you find your
here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three
options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it totally. If
you want to take responsibility for your life, you must choose one of those
three options, and you must choose now. Then accept the consequences. No
excuses. No negativity. No psychic pollution. Keep your inner space clear.
If you take any action leaving or changing your situation drop the
negativity first, if at all possible. Action arising out of insight into what is
required is more effective than action arising out of negativity.
Any action is often better than no action, especially if you have been
stuck in an unhappy situation for a long time. If it is a mistake, at least you
learn something, in which case ifs no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck,
you learn nothing. Is fear preventing you from taking action? Acknowledge
the fear, watch it, take your attention into it, be fully present with it. Doing
so cuts the link between the fear and your thinking. Don't let the fear rise up
into pour mind. Use the power of the Now. Fear cannot prevail against it.
If there is truly nothing that you can do to change your here and now,
and you can't remove yourself from the situation, then accept your here and

now totally by dropping all inner resistance. The false, unhappy self that
loves feeling miserable, resentful, or sorry for itself can then no longer
survive. This is called surrender. Surrender is not weakness. There is great
strength in it. Only a surrendered person has spiritual power. Through
surrender, you will be free internally of the situation. You may then find
that the situation changes without any effort on your part. In any case,
you are free. Or is there something that you “should” be doing but are
not doing it? Get up and do it now. Alternatively, completely accept your
inactivity, laziness, or passivity at this moment, if that is your choice. Go
into it fully. Enjoy it. Be as lazy or inactive as you can. If you go into it
fully and consciously, you will soon come out of it. Or maybe you won't.
Either way, there is no inner conflict, no resistance, no negativity.
Are you stressed? Are you so busy getting to the future that the present
is reduced to a means of getting there? Stress is caused by being “here” but
wanting to be “there,” or being in the present but wanting to be in the
future. Its a split that tears you apart inside. To create and live with such an
inner split is insane. The fact that everyone else is doing it doesn't make it
any less insane. If you have to, you can move fast, work fast, or even run,
without projecting yourself into the future and without resisting the present.
As you move, work, run do it totally. Enjoy the flow of energy, the high
energy of that moment. Now you are no longer stressed, no longer splitting
yourself in two. Just moving, running, working and enjoying it. Or you can
drop the whole thing and sit on a park bench. But when you do, watch your
mind. It may say: “You should be working. You are wasting time.” Observe
the mind. Smile at it.
Does the past take up a great deal of your attention? Do you frequently
talk and think about it, either positively or negatively? The great things that
you have achieved, your adventures or experiences, or your victim story
and the dreadful things that were done to you, or maybe what you did to
someone else? Are your thought processes creating guilt, pride, resentment,
anger, regret, or self-pity? Then you are not only reinforcing a false sense
of self but also helping to accelerate your body's aging process by creating
an accumulation of past in your psyche. Verify this for yourself by
observing those around you who have a strong tendency to hold on to the
past.
Die to the past every moment. You dont need it. Only refer to it when
it is absolutely relevant to the present. Feel the power of this moment and
the fullness of Being. Feel your presence.
¤

Are you worried? Do you have many “what if” thoughts? You are
identified with your mind, which is projecting itself into an imaginary
future situation and creating fear. There is no way that you can cope with
such a situation, because it doesn't exist. It's a mental phantom. You can
stop this health- and life-corroding insanity simply by acknowledging the
present moment. Become aware of your breathing. Feel the air flowing in
and out of your body. Feel your inner energy field. All that you ever have to
deal with, cope with, in real life as opposed to imaginary mind projections
is this moment. Ask yourself what “problem” you have right now, not next
year, tomorrow, or five minutes from now. What is wrong with this
moment? You can always cope with the Now, but you can never cope with
the future nor do you have to. The answer, the strength, the right action or
the resource will be there when you need it, not before, not after.
“One day I'll make it.” Is your goal taking up so much of your
attention that you reduce the present moment to a means to an end? Is it
taking the joy out of your doing? Are you waiting to start living? If you
develop such a mind pattern, no matter what you achieve or get, the present
will never be good enough; the future will always seem better. A perfect
recipe for permanent dissatisfaction and nonfulfillment, don't you agree?
Are you a habitual “waiter”? How much of your life do you spend
waiting? What I call “small-scale waiting” is waiting in line at the post
office, in a traffic jam, at the airport, or waiting for someone to arrive, to
finish work, and so on. “Large-scale waiting” is waiting for the next
vacation, for a better job, for the children to grow up, for a truly meaningful
relationship, for success, to make money, to be important, to become
enlightened. It is not uncommon for people to spend their whole life
waiting to start living.
Waiting is a state of mind. Basically, it means that you want the future;
you don't want the present. You don't want what you've got, and you want
what you haven't got. With every kind of waiting, you unconsciously create
inner conflict between your here and now, where you don't want to be, and
the projected future, where you want to be. This greatly reduces the quality
of your life by making you lose the present.
There is nothing wrong with striving to improve your life situation.
You can improve your life situation, but you cannot improve your life. Life
is primary. Life is your deepest inner Being. It is already whole, complete,
perfect. Your life situation consists of your circumstances youre your
experiences. There is nothing wrong with setting goals and striving to
achieve things. The mistake lies in using it as a substitute for the feeling of

life, for Being. The only point of access for that is the Now. You are then
like an architect who pays no attention to the foundation of a building but
spends a lot of time working on the superstructure.
For example, many people are waiting for prosperity. It cannot come
in the future. When you honor, acknowledge, and fully accept your present
reality where you are, who you are, what you are doing right now when you
fully accept what you have got, you are grateful for what you have got,
grateful for what is, grateful for Being. Gratitude for the present moment
and the fullness of life now is true prosperity.
It cannot come in the future. Then, in time, that prosperity manifests
for you in various ways.
If you are dissatisfied with what you have got, or even frustrated or
angry about your present lack, that may motivate you to become rich, but
even if you do make millions, you will continue to experience the inner
condition of lack, and deep down you will continue to feel unfulfilled. You
may have many exciting experiences that money can buy, but they will
come and go and always leave you with an empty feeling and the need for
further physical or psychological gratification. You won't abide in Being
and so feel the fullness of life now that alone is true prosperity.
So give up waiting as a state of mind. When you catch yourself
slipping into waiting . . . snap out of it. Come into the present moment. Just
be, and enjoy being. If you are present, there is never any need for you to
wait for anything. So next time somebody says, “Sorry to have kept you
waiting,” you can reply, “Thats all right, I wasn't waiting. I was just
standing here enjoying myself in joy in my self.”
These are just a few of the habitual mind strategies for denying the
present moment that are part of ordinary unconsciousness. They are easy to
overlook because they are so much a part of normal living: the background
static of perpetual discontent. But the more you practice monitoring your
inner mental-emotional state, the easier it will be to know when you have
been trapped in past or future, which is to say unconscious, and to awaken
out of the dream of time into the present. But beware: The false, unhappy
self, based on mind identification, lives on time. It knows that the present
moment is its own death and so feels very threatened by it. It will do all it
can to take you out of it. It will try to keep you trapped in time.

THE INNER PURPOSE OF YOUR LIFE'S
JOURNEY
I can see the truth of what you are saying, but I still think that we must
have purpose on our life's journey; otherwise we just drift, and purpose
means future, doesn't it? How do we reconcile that with living in the
present?
When you are on a journey, it is certainly helpful to know where you
are going or at least the general direction in which you are moving, but
don't forget: the only thing that is ultimately real about your journey is the
step that you are taking at this moment. Thats all there ever is.
Your life's journey has an outer purpose and an inner purpose. The
outer purpose is to arrive at your goal or destination, to accomplish what
you set out to do, to achieve this or that, which, of course, implies future.
But if your destination, or the steps you are going to take in the future, take
up so much of your attention that they become more important to you than
the step you are taking now, then you completely miss the journey's inner
purpose, which has nothing to do with where you are going or what you are
doing, but everything to do with how. It has nothing to do with future but
everything to do with the quality of your consciousness at this moment. The
outer purpose belongs to the horizontal dimension of space and time; the
inner purpose concerns a deepening of your Being in the vertical dimension
of the timeless Now. Your outer journey may contain a million steps; your
inner journey only has one: the step you are taking right now. As you
become more deeply aware of this one step, you realize that it already
contains within itself all the other steps as well as the destination. This one
step then becomes transformed into an expression of perfection, an act of
great beauty and quality. It will have taken you into Being, and the light of
Being will shine through it. This is both the purpose and the fulfillment of
your inner journey, the journey into yourself.
¤
Does it matter whether we achieve our outer purpose, whether we
succeed or fail in the world?
It will matter to you as long as you haven't realized your inner purpose.

After that, the outer purpose is just a game that you may continue to play
simply because you enjoy it. It is also possible to fail completely in your
outer purpose and at the same time totally succeed in your inner purpose.
Or the other way around, which is actually more common: outer riches and
inner poverty, or to “gain the world and lose your soul,” as Jesus puts it.
Ultimately, of course, every outer purpose is doomed to “fail” sooner or
later, simply because it is subject to the law of impermanence of all things.
The sooner you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting
fulfillment, the better. When you have seen the limitations of your outer
purpose, you give up your unrealistic expectation that it should make you
happy, and you make it subservient to your inner purpose.

THE PAST CANNOT SURVIVE IN YOUR
PRESENCE
You mentioned that thinking or talking about the past unnecessarily is
one of the ways in which we avoid the present. But apart from the past that
we remember and perhaps identify with, isn't there another level of past
within us that is much more deep-seated? I am talking about the
unconscious past that conditions our lives, especially through early
childhood experiences, perhaps even past-life experiences. And then there
is our cultural conditioning, which has to do with where we live
geographically and the historical time period in which we live. All these
things determine how we see the world, how we react, what we think, what
kind of relationships we have, how we live our lives. How could we ever
become conscious of all that or get rid of it? How long would that take?
And even if we did, what would there be left?
What is left when illusion ends? There is no need to investigate the
unconscious past in you except as it manifests at this moment as a thought,
an emotion, a desire, a reaction, or an external event that happens to you.
Whatever you need to know about the unconscious past in you, the
challenges of the present will bring it out. If you delve into the past, it will
become a bottomless pit: There is always more. You may think that you
need more time to understand the past or become free of it, in other words,
that the future will eventually free you of the past. This is a delusion. Only
the present can free you of the past. More time cannot free you of time.
Access the power of Now. That is the key. What is the power of Now?
None other than the power of your presence, your consciousness
liberated from thought forms.
So deal with the past on the level of the present. The more attention
you give to the past, the more you energize it, and the more likely you are
to make a “self” out of it. Dont misunderstand: Attention is essential, but
not to the past as past. Give attention to the present; give attention to your
behavior, to your reactions, moods, thoughts, emotions, fears,
and desires as they occur in the present. There's the past in you. If you
can be present enough to watch all those things, not critically or analytically

but nonjudgmentally, then you are dealing with the past and dissolving it
through the power of your presence. You cannot find yourself by going into
the past. You find yourself by coming into the present.
Isn't it helpful to understand the past and so understand why we do
certain things, react in certain ways, or why we unconsciously create our
particular kind of drama, patterns in relationships, and so on?
As you become more conscious of your present reality, you may
suddenly get certain insights as to why your conditioning functions in those
particular ways; for example, why your relationships follow certain
patterns, and you may remember things that happened in the past or see
them more dearly. That is fine and can be helpful, but it is not essential.
What is essential is your conscious presence. That dissolves the past. That
is the transformative agent. So don't seek to understand the past, but be as
present as you can. The past cannot survive in your presence. It can only
survive in your absence.
