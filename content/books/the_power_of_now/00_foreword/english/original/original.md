FOREWORD
BY RUSSELL E. DICARLO Author of Towards a New World View
Blanketed by an azure sky, the orange-yellow rays of the setting sun can, at
special times, gift us with a moment of such consider able beauty, we find
ourselves momentarily stunned, with frozen gaze. The splendor of the
moment so dazzles us, our compulsively chattering minds give pause, so as
not to mentally whisk us away to a place other than the here-and-now.
Bathed in luminescence, a door seems to open to another reality, always
present, yet rarely witnessed.
Abraham Maslow called these “peak experiences,” since they
represent the high moments of life where we joyfully find ourselves
catapulted beyond the confines of the mundane and ordinary. He might just
as well have called them “peek” experiences. During these expansive
occasions, we sneak a glimpse of the eternal realm of Being itself. If only
for a brief moment in time, we come home to our True Self. “Ah,” one
might sigh, “so grand . . . if only I could stay here. But how do I take up
permanent residence?“ During the past ten years, I have committed myself
to finding out. During my search, I have been honored to engage in
dialogue with some of the most daring, inspiring and insightful ”paradigm
pioneers“ of our time: in medicine, science, psychology, business,
religion/spirituality, and human potential. This diverse group of individuals
is joined by their commonly voiced insight that humanity is now taking a
quantum leap forward in its evolutionary development. This change is
accompanied by a shift in world view the basic picture we carry with us of
”the way things are.“ A world view seeks to answer two fundamental
questions, ”Who are we?“ and ”What is the nature of the Universe in which
we live?” Our answers to these questions dictate the quality and
characteristics of our personal relationships with family, friends and
employers/employees. When considered on a larger scale, they define
societies.
It should be of little surprise that the world view which is emerging
calls into question many of the things Western society holds to be true:
MYTH #1 Humanity has reached the pinnacle of its development.
Esalen co-founder Michael Murphy, drawing upon comparative

religious studies, medical science, anthropology, and sports, has made a
provocative case that there are more advanced stages of human
development. As a person reaches these advanced levels of spiritual
maturity, extraordinary capacities begin to blossom of love, vitality,
personhood, bodily awareness, intuition, perception, communication, and
volition. First step: to recognize they exist. Most people do not.
Then, methods can be employed with conscious intention.
MYTH #2 We are completely separate from each other, nature, and
the Kosmos.
This myth of “other-than-me” has been responsible for wars, the rape
of the planet, and all forms and expressions of human injustice. After alt,
who in their right mind would harm another if they experienced that person
as part of themselves? Stan Grof, in his research of non-ordinary states of
consciousness, summarizes by saying “the psyche and consciousness of
each of us is, in the last analysis, commensurate with ”All-That-Is“ because
there are no absolute boundaries between the body/ego and the totality of
existence.”
Dr. Larry Dossey's Era-3 medicine, where the thoughts, attitudes, and
healing intentions of one individual can influence the physiology of another
person (in contrast to Era-z, prevailing mind-body medicine) is very well
supported by scientific studies into the healing power of prayer. Now this
can't happen according to the known principles of physics and world view
of traditional science. Yet the preponderance of evidence suggests that
indeed it does.
MYTH #3 The physical world is all there is.
Materialistically bound, traditional science assumes that anything that
cannot be measured, tested in a laboratory, or probed by the five senses or
their technological extensions simply doesn't exist. Ifs “not real.” The
consequence: all of reality has been collapsed into physical reality.
Spiritual, or what I would call nonphysical, dimensions of reality have been
run out of town.
This clashes with the “perennial philosophy,” that philosophical
consensus spanning ages, religions, traditions, and cultures, which describes
different but continuous dimensions of reality. These run from the most
dense and least conscious what we'd call “matter” to the least dense and
most conscious, which we'd call spiritual.
Interestingly enough, this extended, multidimensional model of reality
is suggested by quantum theorists such as Jack Scarfetti who describes
superluminal travel. Other dimensions of reality are used to explain travel

that occurs faster than the speed of light the ultimate of speed limits. Or
consider the work of the legendary physicist, David Bohm, with his
explicate (physical) and implicate (non- physical) multidimensional model
of reality.
This is no mere theory the i982 Aspect Experiment in France
demonstrated, that two once-connected quantum particles separated by vast
distances remained somehow connected. If one particle was changed, the
other changed instantly. Scientists don't know the mechanics of how this
faster-than-the-speed-of-light travel can happen, though some theorists
suggest that this connection takes place via doorways into higher
dimensions.
So contrary to what those who pledge their allegiance to the traditional
paradigm might think, the influential, pioneering individuals I spoke with
felt that we have not reached the pinnacle of human development, we are
connected, rather than separate, from all of life, and that the full spectrum
of consciousness encompasses both physical and a multitude of nonphysical
dimensions of reality.
At core, this new world view involves seeing yourself, others, and all
of life, not through the eyes of our small, earthly self that lives in time and
is born in time. But rather through the eyes of the soul, our Being, the True
Self. One by one,
people are jumping to this higher orbit. With his book, The Power of
Now, Eckhart Tolle rightfully takes his place among this special group of
world- class teachers. Eckharts message: the problem of humanity is deeply
rooted in the mind itself. Or rather, our misidentification with mind.
Our drifting awareness, our tendency to take the path of least
resistance by being less than fully awake to the present moment, creates a
void. And the time-bound mind, which has been designed to be a useful
servant, compensates by proclaiming itself master. Like a butterfly flittering
from one flower to another, the mind engages past experiences or,
projecting its own made-for-television movie, anticipates what is to come.
Seldom do we find ourselves resting in the oceanic depth of the here and
now. For it is here in the Now where we find our True Self, which lies
behind our physical body, shifting emotions, and chattering mind.
The crowning glory of human development rests not in our ability to
reason and think, though this is what distinguishes us from animals.
Intellect, like instinct, is merely a point along the way. Our ultimate destiny
is to re- connect with our essential Being and express from our
extraordinary, divine reality in the ordinary physical world, moment by

moment. Easy to say, yet rare are those who have attained the further
reaches of human development.
Fortunately, there are guides and teachers to help us along the way. As
a teacher and guide, Eckhart's formidable power lies not in his adept ability
to delight us with entertaining stories, make the abstract concrete, or
provide useful technique. Rather, his magic is seated in his personal
experience, as one who knows. As a result, there is a power behind his
words found only in the most celebrated of spiritual teachers. By living
from the depths of this Greater Reality, Eckhart clears an energetic pathway
for others to join him.
And what if others do? Surely the world as we know it would change
for the better. Values would shift in the flotsam of vanishing fears that have
been funneled away through the whirlpool of Being itself. A new
civilization would be born.
“Where's the proof of this Greater Reality?” you ask. I offer only an
analogy. A battery of scientists can get together and tell you about all the
scientific proof for the fact that bananas are bitter. But all you have to do is
taste one, once, to realize that there is this whole other aspect to bananas.
Ultimately, proof lies not in intellectual arguments, but in being touched in
some way by the sacred within and without.
Eckhart Tolle masterfully opens us to that possibility.
