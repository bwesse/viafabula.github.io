# Moving Deeply Into The Now

Chapter One

MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW

DON'T SEEK YOUR SELF IN THE MIND
I feel that there is still ct great deal I need to learn about the workings
of my mind before I can get anywhere near full consciousness or spiritual
enlightenment.
No, you don't. The problems of the mind cannot be solved on the level
of the mind. Once you have understood the basic dysfunction, there isnt
really much else that you need to learn or understand. Studying the
complexities of the mind may make you a good psychologist, but doing so
won't take you beyond the mind, just as the study of madness isn't enough
to create sanity. You have already understood the basic mechanics of the
unconscious state: identification with the mind, which creates a false self,
the ego, as a substitute for your true self rooted in Being. You become as a
“branch cut off from the vine,” as Jesus puts it.
The ego's needs are endless. It feels vulnerable and threatened and so
lives in a state of fear and want. Once you know how the basic dysfunction
operates, there is no need to explore all its countless manifestations, no
need to make it into a complex personal problem. The ego, of course, loves
that. It is always seeking for something to attach itself to in order to uphold
and strengthen its illusory sense of self, and it will readily attach itself to
your problems. This is why, for so many people, a large part of their sense
of self is intimately connected with their problems. Once this has happened,
the last thing they want is to become free of them; that would mean loss of
self. There can be a great deal of unconscious ego investment in pain and
suffering.
So once you recognize the root of unconsciousness as identification
with the mind, which of course includes the emotions, you step out of it.
You become present. When you are present, you can allow the mind to be
as it is without getting entangled in it. The mind in itself is not
dysfunctional.
It is a wonderful tool. Dysfunction sets in when you seek your self in it
and mistake it for who you are. It then becomes the egoic mind and takes
over your whole life.

END THE DELUSION OF TIME
It seems almost impossible to disidentify from the mind. We are all
immersed in it. How do you teach a fish to fly?
Here is the key: End the delusion of time. Time and mind are
inseparable. Remove time from the mind and it stops unless you choose to
use it.
To be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time: the
compulsion to live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation.
This creates an endless preoccupation with past and future and an
unwillingness to honor and acknowledge the present moment and allow it
to be. The compulsion arises because the past gives you an identity and the
future holds the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in whatever form. Both
are illusions.
But without a sense of time, how would we function in this world?
There would be no goals to strive toward anymore. I wouldn't even know
who I am, because my past makes me who I am today. I think time is
something very precious, and we need to learn to use it wisely rather than
waste it. Time isn't precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you
perceive as precious is not time but the one point that is out of time: the
Now. That is precious indeed. The more you are focused on time past and
future the more you miss the Now, the most precious thing there is.
Why is it the most precious thing? Firstly, because it is the only thing.
Its all there is. The eternal present is the space within which your whole life
unfolds, the one factor that remains constant. Life is now. There was never
a time when your life was not now, nor will there ever be. Secondly,
the Now is the only point that can take you beyond the limited
confines of the mind. It is your only point of access into the timeless and
formless realm of Being.
¤

NOTHING EXISTS OUTSIDE THE NOW
Aren't past and future just as real, sometimes even more real, than the
present? After all, the past determines who we are, as well as how we
perceive and behave in the present. And our future goals determine which
actions we take in the present.
You havent yet grasped the essence of what I am saying because you
are trying to understand it mentally. The mind cannot understand this. Only
you can. Please just listen.
Have you ever experienced, done, thought, or felt anything outside the
Now? Do you think you ever will? Is it possible for anything to happen or
be outside the Now? The answer is obvious, is it not? Nothing ever
happened in the past; it happened in the Now.
Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in the Now.
What you think of as the past is a memory trace, stored in the mind, of
a former Now. When you remember the past, you reactivate a memory trace
and you do so now. The future is an imagined Now, a projection of the
mind. When the future comes, it comes as the Now. When you think about
the future, you do it now. Past and future obviously have no reality of their
own. Just as the moon has no light of its own, but can only reflect the light
of the sun, so are past and future only pale reflections of the light, power,
and reality of the eternal present. Their reality is “borrowed” from the Now.
The essence of what I am saying here cannot be understood by the
mind. The moment you grasp it, there is a shift in consciousness from mind
to Being, from time to presence. Suddenly, everything feels alive, radiates
energy, emanates Being.
¤

THE KEY TO THE SPIRITUAL
DIMENSION
In life-threatening emergency situations, the shift in consciousness
from time to presence sometimes happens naturally. The personality that
has a past and a future momentarily recedes and is replaced by an intense
conscious presence, very still but very alert at the same time. Whatever
response is needed then arises out of that state of consciousness. The reason
why some people love to engage in dangerous activities, such as mountain
climbing, car racing, and so on, although they may not be aware of it, is that
it forces them into the Now that intensely alive state that is free of time, free
of problems, free of thinking, free of the burden of the personality. Slipping
away from the present moment even for a second may mean death.
Unfortunately, they come to depend on a particular activity to be in that
state. But you don't need to climb the north face of the Eiger. You can enter
that state now.
¤
Since ancient times, spiritual masters of all traditions have pointed to
the Now as the key to the spiritual dimension. Despite this, it seems to have
remained a secret. It is certainly not taught in churches and temples. If you
go to a church, you may hear readings from the Gospels such as “Take no
thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of
itself,” or “Nobody who puts his hands to the plow and looks back is fit for
the Kingdom of God.” Or you might hear the passage about the beautiful
flowers that are not anxious about tomorrow but live with ease in the
timeless Now and are provided for abundantly by God. The depth and
radical nature of these teachings are not recognized. No one seems to
realize that they are meant to be lived and so bring about a profound inner
transformation.
¤ The whole essence of Zen consists in walking along the razor's edge
of Now to be so utterly, so completely present that no problem, no
suffering, nothing that is not who you are in your essence, can survive in
you. In the Now, in the absence of time, all your problems dissolve.
Suffering needs time; it cannot survive in the Now.

The great Zen master Rinzai, in order to take his students' attention
away from time, would often raise his finger and slowly ask: “What, at this
moment, is lacking?” A powerful question that does not require an answer
on the level of the mind. It is designed to take your attention deeply into the
Now. A similar question in the Zen tradition is this: “If not now, when?”
¤
The Now is also central to the teaching of Sufism, the mystical branch
of Islam. Sufis have a saying: “The Sufi is the son of time present.” And
Rumi, the great poet and teacher of Sufism, declares: “Past and future veil
God from our sight; burn up both of them with fire.”
Meister Eckhart, the thirteenth-century spiritual teacher, summed it all
up beautifully “Time is what keeps the light from reaching us. There is no
greater obstacle to God than time.”
¤

ACCESSING THE POWER OF THE NOW
A moment ago, when you talked about the eternal present and the
unreality of past and future, I found myself looking at that tree outside the
window. I had looked at it a few times before, but this time it was different.
The external perception had not changed much, except that the colors
seemed brighter and more vibrant. But there was now an added dimension
to it. This is hard to explain. I don't know how, but I was aware of
something invisible that I felt was the essence of that tree, its inner spirit, if
you like. And somehow I was part of that. I realize now that I hadn't truly
seen the tree before, just a flat and dead image of it. When I look at the tree
now, some of that awareness is still present, but I can feel it slipping away.
You see, the experience is already receding into the past. Can something
like this ever be more than affecting glimpse?
You were free of time for a moment. You moved into the Now and
therefore perceived the tree without the screen of mind. The awareness of
Being became part of your perception. With the timeless dimension comes
a different kind of knowing, one that does not “kill” the spirit that lives
within every creature and every thing. A knowing that does not destroy the
sacredness and mystery of life but contains a deep love and reverence for
all that is. A knowing of which the mind knows nothing.
The mind cannot know the tree. It can only know facts or information
about the tree. My mind cannot know you, only labels, judgments, facts,
and opinions about you. Being alone knows directly.
There is a place for mind and mind knowledge. It is in the practical
realm of day-to-day living. However, when it takes over all aspects of your
life, including your relationships with other human beings and with nature,
it becomes a monstrous parasite that, unchecked, may well end up killing
all life on the planet and finally itself by killing its host.
You have had a glimpse of how the timeless can transform your
perceptions. But an experience is not enough, no matter how beautiful or
profound. What is needed and what we are concerned with is a permanent
shift in consciousness.
So break the old pattern of present-moment denial and present-
moment resistance. Make it your practice to withdraw attention from past

and future whenever they are not needed. Step out of the time dimension as
much as possible in everyday life. If you find it hard to enter the Now
directly, start by observing the habitual tendency of your mind to want to
escape from the Now. You will observe that the future is usually imagined
as either better or worse than the present. If the imagined future is better, it
gives you hope or pleasurable anticipation. If it is worse, it creates anxiety.
Both are illusory. Through self-observation, more presence comes into your
life automatically. The moment you realize you are not present, you are
present. Whenever you are able to observe your mind, you are no longer
trapped in it. Another factor has come in, something that is not of the mind:
the witnessing presence. Be present as the watcher of your mind of
your thoughts and emotions as well as your reactions in various situations.
Be at least as interested in your reactions as in the situation or person that
causes you to react. Notice also how often your attention is in the past or
future. Don't judge or analyze what you observe. Watch the thought, feel
the emotion, observe the reaction. Dont make a personal problem out of
them. You will then feel something more powerful than any of those things
that you observe: the still, observing presence itself behind the content of
your mind, the silent watcher. ¤
Intense presence is needed when certain situations trigger a reaction
with a strong emotional charge, such as when your self-image is threatened,
a challenge comes into your life that triggers fear, things “go wrong,” or an
emotional complex from the past is brought up. In those instances, the
tendency is for you to become “unconscious.” The reaction or emotion
takes you over you “become” it. You act it out. You justify, make wrong,
attack, defend . . . except that it isn't you, it's the reactive pattern, the mind
in its habitual survival mode.
Identification with the mind gives it more energy;, observation of the
mind withdraws energy from it. Identification with the mind creates more
time; observation of the mind opens up the dimension of the timeless. The
energy that is withdrawn from the mind turns into presence. Once you can
feel what it means to be present, it becomes much easier to simply choose
to step out of the time dimension whenever time is not needed for practical
purposes and move more deeply into the Now. This does not impair your
ability to use time past or future when you need to refer to it for practical
matters. Nor does it impair your ability to use your mind. In fact, it
enhances it. When you do use your mind, it will be sharper, more focused.

LETTING GO OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TIME
Learn to use time in the practical aspects of your life we may call this
“clock time” but immediately return to present-moment awareness when
those practical matters have been dealt with. In this way, there will be no
build-up of “psychological time,” which is identification with the past and
continuous compulsive projection into the future.
Clock time is not just making an appointment or planning a trip. It
includes learning from the past so that we don't repeat the same mistakes
over and over. Setting goals and working toward them. Predicting the future
by means of patterns and laws, physical, mathematical and so on, learned
from the past and taking appropriate action on the basis of our predictions.
But even here, within the sphere of practical living, where we cannot
do without reference to past and future, the present moment remains the
essential factor, Any lesson from the past becomes relevant and is applied
now. Any planning as well as working toward achieving a particular goal is
done now.
The enlightened person's main focus of attention is always the Now,
but they are still peripherally aware of time. In other words, they continue
to use clock time but are free of psychological time.
Be alert as you practice this so that you do not unwittingly transform
clock time into psychological time. For example, if you made a mistake in
the past and learn from it now, you are using clock time. On the other hand,
if you dwell on it mentally, and self-criticism, remorse, or guilt come up,
then you are making the mistake into “me” and “mine”: you make it part of
your sense of self, and it has become psychological time, which is always
linked to a false sense of identity. Nonforgiveness necessarily implies a
heavy burden of psychological time.
If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using clock time.
You are aware of where you want to go, but you honor and give your fullest
attention to the step that you are taking at this moment. If you then become
excessively focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking
happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no
longer honored. It becomes reduced to a mere stepping stone to the future,
with no intrinsic value. Clock time then turns into psychological time. Your

life's journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to
attain, to “make it.” You no longer see or smell the flowers by the wayside
either, nor are you aware of the beauty and the miracle of life that unfolds
all around you when you are present in the Now.
¤
I can see the supreme importance of the Now, but I cannot quite go
along with you when you say that time is a complete illusion.
When I say “time is an illusion,” my intention is not to make a
philosophical statement. I am just reminding you of a simple fact a fact so
obvious that you may find it hard to grasp and may even find it meaningless
but once fully realized, it can cut like a sword through all the mind-created
layers of complexity and “problems.” Let me say it again: the present
moment is all you ever have. There is never a time when your life is not
“this moment.” Is this not a fact?

THE INSANITY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL
TIME
You will not have any doubt that psychological time is a mental
disease if you look at its collective manifestations. They occur, for example,
in the form of ideologies such as communism, national socialism or any
nationalism, or rigid religious belief systems, which operate under the
implicit assumption that the highest good lies in the future and that
therefore the end justifies the means. The end is an idea, a point in the
mind-projected future, when salvation in whatever form happiness,
fulfillment, equality, liberation, and so on will be attained. Not infrequently,
the means of getting there are the enslavement, torture, and murder of
people in the present.
For example, it is estimated that as many as 50 million people were
murdered to further the cause of communism, to bring about a “better
world” in Russia, China, and other countries. This is a chilling example of
how belief in a future heaven creates a present hell. Can there be any doubt
that psychological time is a serious and dangerous mental illness?
How does this mind pattern operate in your life? Are you always
trying to get somewhere other than where you are? Is most of your doing
just a means to an end? Is fulfillment always just around the corner or
confined to short-lived pleasures, such as sex, food, drink, drugs, or thrills
and excitement? Are you always focused on becoming,
achieving, and attaining, or alternatively chasing some new thrill or
pleasure? Do you believe that if you acquire more things you will become
more fulfilled, good enough, or psychologically complete? Are you waiting
for a man or woman to give meaning to your life?
In the normal, mind-identified or unenlightened state of consciousness,
the power and infinite creative potential that lie concealed in the Now are
completely obscured by psychological time. Your life then loses its
vibrancy, its freshness, its sense of wonder. The old patterns of thought,
emotion, behavior, reaction, and desire are acted out in endless repeat
performances, a script in your mind that gives you an identity of sorts but
distorts or covers up the reality of the Now. The mind then creates an

obsession with the future as an escape from the unsatisfactory present.

NEGATIVITY AND SUFFERING HAVE
THEIR ROOTS IN TIME
But the belief that the future will be better than the present is not
always an illusion. The present can be dreadful, and things can get better in
the future, and often they do.
Usually, the future is a replica of the past. Superficial changes are
possible, but real transformation is rare and depends upon whether you can
become present enough to dissolve the past by accessing the power of the
Now. What you perceive as future is an intrinsic part of your state of
consciousness now. If your mind carries a heavy burden of past, you will
experience more of the same. The past perpetuates itself through lack of
presence. The quality of your consciousness at this moment is what shapes
the future which, of course, can only be experienced as the Now.
You may win $10 million, but that kind of change is no more than skin
deep. You would simply continue to act out the same conditioned patterns
in more luxurious surroundings. Humans have learned to split the atom.
Instead of killing ten or twenty people with a wooden club, one person can
now kill a million just by pushing a button. Is that real change?
If it is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that
determines the future, then what is it that determines the quality of your
consciousness? Your degree of presence. So the only place where true
change can occur and where the past can be dissolved is the Now.
¤
All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and
denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry all forms of
fear are caused by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret,
resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness
are caused by too much past, and not enough presence.
Most people find it difficult to believe that a state of consciousness
totally free of all negativity is possible. And yet this is the liberated state to
which all spiritual teachings point. It is the promise of salvation, not in an
illusory future but right here and now.
You may find it hard to recognize that time is the cause of your

suffering or your problems. You believe that they are caused by specific
situations in your life, and seen from a conventional viewpoint, this is true.
But until you have dealt with the basic problem-making dysfunction of the
mind its attachment to past and future and denial of the Now problems are
actually interchangeable. If all your problems or perceived causes of
suffering or unhappiness were miraculously removed for you today, but you
had not become more present, more conscious, you would soon find
yourself with a similar set of problems or causes of suffering, like a shadow
that follows you wherever you go. Ultimately, there is only one problem:
the time-bound mind itself.
I cannot believe that I could ever reach a point where I am completely
free of my problems.
You are right. You can never reach that point because you are at that
point now.
There is no salvation in time. You cannot be free in the future.
Presence is the key to freedom, so you can only be free now.

FINDING THE LIFE UNDERNEATH YOUR
LIFE SITUATION
I don't see how I can be free now. As it happens, I am extremely
unhappy with my life at the moment. This is a fact, and I would be deluding
myself if I tried to convince myself that all is well when it definitely isn't.
To me, the present moment is very unhappy; it is not liberating at all. What
keeps me going is the hope or possibility of some improvement in the
future.
You think that your attention is in the present moment when it's
actually taken up completely by time. You cannot be both unhappy and
fully present in the Now.
What you refer to as your “life” should more accurately be called your
“life situation.” It is psychological time: past and future. Certain things in
the past didn't go the way you wanted them to go. You are still resisting
what happened in the past, and now you are resisting what is. Hope is what
keeps you going, but hope keeps you focused on the future, and this
continued focus perpetuates your denial of the Now and therefore your
unhappiness.
It is true that my present life situation is the result of things that
happened in the past, but it is still my present situation, and being stuck in it
is what makes me unhappy.
Forget about your life situation for a while and pay attention to your
life.
What is the difference?
Your life situation exists in time. Your life is now.
Your life situation is mind-stuff. Your life is real. Find the “narrow
gate that leads to life.” It is called the Now. Narrow your life down to this
moment. Your life situation may be full of problems most life situations are
but find out if you have any problem at this moment. Not tomorrow or in
ten minutes, but now. Do you have a problem now?
When you are full of problems, there is no room for anything new to
enter, no room for a solution. So whenever you can, make some room,
create some space, so that you find the life underneath your life situation.

Use your senses fully. Be where you are. Look around. Just look, don't
interpret. See the light, shapes, colors, textures. Be aware of the silent
presence of each thing. Be aware of the space that allows everything to be.
Listen to the sounds; don't judge them. Listen to the silence underneath the
sounds. Touch something anything and feel and acknowledge its Being.
Observe the rhythm of your breathing; feel the air flowing in and out, feel
the life energy inside your body. Allow everything to be, within and
without.
Allow the “isness” of all things. Move deeply into the Now. You are
leaving behind the deadening world of mental abstraction, of time. You are
getting out of the insane mind that is draining you of life energy, just as it is
slowly poisoning and destroying the Earth. You are awakening out of the
dream of time into the present.
¤

ALL PROBLEMS ARE ILLUSIONS OF THE
MIND
It feels as if a heavy burden has been lifted. A sense of lightness. I feel
clear . . . but my problems are still there waiting for me, aren't they? They
haven't been solved. Am I not just temporarily evading them?
If you found yourself in paradise, it wouldn't be long before your mind
would say “yes, but . . . ”Ultimately, this is not about solving your
problems. Ifs about realizing that there are no problems. Only situations to
be dealt with now, or to be left alone and accepted as part of the "isness' of
the present moment until they change or can be dealt with. Problems are
mind-made and need time to survive. They cannot survive in the actuality
of the Now.
Focus your attention on the Now and tell me what problem you have at
this moment.
¤
I am not getting any answer because it is impossible to have a problem
when your attention is fully in the Now. A situation that needs to be either
dealt with or accepted yes. Why make it into a problem? Why make
anything into a problem? Isn't life challenging enough as it is? What do you
need problems for? The mind unconsciously loves problems because they
give you an identity of sorts. This is normal, and it is insane. “Problem”
means that you are dwelling on a situation mentally without there being a
true intention or possibility of taking action now and that you are
unconsciously making it part of your sense of self. You become so
overwhelmed by your life situation that you lose your sense of life, of
Being. Or you are carrying in your mind the insane burden of a hundred
things that you will or may have to do in the future instead of focusing your
attention on the one thing that you can do now.
When you create a problem, you create pain. All it takes is a simple
choice, a simple decision: no matter what happens, I will create no more
pain for myself. I will create no more problems. Although it is a simple
choice, it is also very radical. You wont make that choice unless you are
truly fed up with suffering, unless you have truly had enough.

And you won't be able to go through with it unless you access the
power of the Now. If you create no more pain for yourself, then you create
no more pain for others. You also no longer contaminate the beautiful
Earth, your inner space, and the collective human psyche with the
negativity of problem-making.
¤
If you have ever been in a life-or-death emergency situation, you will
know that it wasn't a problem. The mind didn't have time to fool around and
make it into a problem. In a true emergency, the mind stops; you become
totally present in the Now, and something infinitely more powerful takes
over. This is why there are many reports of ordinary people suddenly
becoming capable of incredibly courageous deeds. In any emergency, either
you survive or you don't. Either way, it is not a problem.
Some people get angry when they hear me say that problems are
illusions. I am threatening to take away their sense of who they are. They
have invested much time in a false sense of self. For many years, they have
unconsciously defined their whole identity in terms of their problems or
their suffering. Who would they be without it?
A great deal of what people say, think, or do is actually motivated by
fear, which of course is always linked with having your focus on the future
and being out of touch with the Now. As there are no problems in the Now,
there is no fear either.
Should a situation arise that you need to deal with now, your action
will be clear and incisive if it arises out of present-moment awareness. It is
also more likely to be effective. It will not be a reaction coming from the
past conditioning of your mind but an intuitive response to the situation. In
other instances, when the time-bound mind would have reacted, you will
find it more effective to do nothing just stay centered in the Now.

A QUANTUM LEAP IN THE EVOLUTION
OF CONSCIOUSNESS
I have had glimpses of this state off freedom from mind and time that
you describe, but past and future are so overwhelmingly strong that I cannot
keep them out for long.
The time-bound mode of consciousness is deeply embedded in the
human psyche. But what we are doing here is part of a profound
transformation that is taking place in the collective consciousness of the
planet and beyond: the awakening of consciousness from the dream of
matter, form, and separation. The ending of time. We are breaking mind
patterns that have dominated human life for eons. Mind patterns that have
created unimaginable suffering on a vast scale. I am not using the word
evil. It is more helpful to call it unconsciousness or insanity.
This breaking up of the old mode of consciousness or rather
unconsciousness: is it something we have to do or will it happen anyway? I
mean, is this change inevitable?
Thats a question of perspective. The doing and the happening is in fact
a single process; because you are one with the totality of consciousness,
you cannot separate the two. But there is no absolute guarantee that humans
will make it. The process isn't inevitable or automatic. Your cooperation is
an essential part of it. However you look at it, it is a quantum leap in the
evolution of consciousness, as well as our only chance of survival as a race.

THE JOY OF BEING
To alert you that you have allowed yourself to be taken over by
psychological time, you can use a simple criterion. Ask yourself: Is there
joy, ease, and lightness in what I am doing? If there isn't, then time is
covering up the present moment, and life is perceived as a burden or a
struggle.
If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does not
necessarily mean that you need to change what you are doing. It may be
sufficient to change the how. “How” is always more important than “what.”
See if you can give much more attention to the doing than to the result that
you want to achieve through it. Give your fullest attention to whatever the
moment presents. This implies that you also completely accept what is,
because you cannot give your full attention to something and at the same
time resist it.
As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and
struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act
out of present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a
sense of quality, care, and love even the most simple action.
¤
So do not be concerned with the fruit of your action just give attention
to the action itself. The fruit will come of its own accord. This is a powerful
spiritual practice. In the Bhagavad Gita, one of the oldest and most
beautiful spiritual teachings in existence, non-attachment to the fruit of your
action is called Karma Yoga. It is described as the path of “consecrated
action.”
When the compulsive striving away from the Now ceases, the joy of
Being flows into everything you do. The moment your attention turns to the
Now, you feel a presence, a stillness, a peace. You no longer depend on the
future for fulfillment and satisfaction you don't look to it for salvation.
Therefore, you are not attached to the results. Neither failure nor success
has the power to change your inner state of Being. You have found the life
underneath your life situation.
In the absence of psychological time, your sense of self is derived
from Being, not from your personal past. Therefore, the psychological need

to become anything other than who you are already is no longer there. In
the world, on the level of your life situation, you may indeed become
wealthy, knowledgeable, successful, free of this or that, but in the deeper
dimension of Being you are complete and whole now.
In that state of wholeness, would we still be able or willing to pursue
external goals ?
Of course, but you will not have illusory expectations that anything or
anybody in the future will save you or make you happy. As far as your life
situation is concerned, there may be things to be attained or acquired. Thats
the world of form,
of gain and loss. Yet on a deeper level you are already complete, and
when you realize that, there is a playful, joyous energy behind what you do.
Being free of psychological time, you no longer pursue your goals with
grim determination, driven by fear, anger, discontent, or the need to become
someone. Nor will you remain inactive through fear of failure, which to the
ego is loss of self. When your deeper sense of self is derived from Being,
when you are free of “becoming” as a psychological need, neither your
happiness nor your sense of self depends on the outcome, and so there is
freedom from fear. You don't seek permanency where it cannot be found: in
the world of form, of gain and loss, birth and death. You don't demand that
situations, conditions, places, or people should make you happy, and then
suffer when they don't live up to your expectations.
Everything is honored, but nothing matters. Forms are born and die,
yet you are aware of the eternal underneath the forms. You know that
“nothing real can be threatened.”
When this is your state of Being, how can you not succeed? You have
succeeded already.
