# The Key To The Spiritual Dimension

THE KEY TO THE SPIRITUAL
DIMENSION
In life-threatening emergency situations, the shift in consciousness
from time to presence sometimes happens naturally. The personality that
has a past and a future momentarily recedes and is replaced by an intense
conscious presence, very still but very alert at the same time. Whatever
response is needed then arises out of that state of consciousness. The reason
why some people love to engage in dangerous activities, such as mountain
climbing, car racing, and so on, although they may not be aware of it, is that
it forces them into the Now that intensely alive state that is free of time, free
of problems, free of thinking, free of the burden of the personality. Slipping
away from the present moment even for a second may mean death.
Unfortunately, they come to depend on a particular activity to be in that
state. But you don't need to climb the north face of the Eiger. You can enter
that state now.

Since ancient times, spiritual masters of all traditions have pointed to
the Now as the key to the spiritual dimension. Despite this, it seems to have
remained a secret. It is certainly not taught in churches and temples. If you
go to a church, you may hear readings from the Gospels such as “Take no
thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of
itself,” or “Nobody who puts his hands to the plow and looks back is fit for
the Kingdom of God.” Or you might hear the passage about the beautiful
flowers that are not anxious about tomorrow but live with ease in the
timeless Now and are provided for abundantly by God. The depth and
radical nature of these teachings are not recognized. No one seems to
realize that they are meant to be lived and so bring about a profound inner
transformation.
¤ The whole essence of Zen consists in walking along the razor's edge
of Now to be so utterly, so completely present that no problem, no
suffering, nothing that is not who you are in your essence, can survive in
you. In the Now, in the absence of time, all your problems dissolve.
Suffering needs time; it cannot survive in the Now.

The great Zen master Rinzai, in order to take his students' attention
away from time, would often raise his finger and slowly ask: “What, at this
moment, is lacking?” A powerful question that does not require an answer
on the level of the mind. It is designed to take your attention deeply into the
Now. A similar question in the Zen tradition is this: “If not now, when?”

The Now is also central to the teaching of Sufism, the mystical branch
of Islam. Sufis have a saying: “The Sufi is the son of time present.” And
Rumi, the great poet and teacher of Sufism, declares: “Past and future veil
God from our sight; burn up both of them with fire.”
Meister Eckhart, the thirteenth-century spiritual teacher, summed it all
up beautifully “Time is what keeps the light from reaching us. There is no
greater obstacle to God than time.”
