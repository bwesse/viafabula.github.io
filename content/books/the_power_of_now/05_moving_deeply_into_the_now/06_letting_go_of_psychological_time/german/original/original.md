# Letting Go Of Psychological Time

LETTING GO OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TIME
Learn to use time in the practical aspects of your life we may call this
“clock time” but immediately return to present-moment awareness when
those practical matters have been dealt with. In this way, there will be no
build-up of “psychological time,” which is identification with the past and
continuous compulsive projection into the future.
Clock time is not just making an appointment or planning a trip. It
includes learning from the past so that we don't repeat the same mistakes
over and over. Setting goals and working toward them. Predicting the future
by means of patterns and laws, physical, mathematical and so on, learned
from the past and taking appropriate action on the basis of our predictions.
But even here, within the sphere of practical living, where we cannot
do without reference to past and future, the present moment remains the
essential factor, Any lesson from the past becomes relevant and is applied
now. Any planning as well as working toward achieving a particular goal is
done now.
The enlightened person's main focus of attention is always the Now,
but they are still peripherally aware of time. In other words, they continue
to use clock time but are free of psychological time.
Be alert as you practice this so that you do not unwittingly transform
clock time into psychological time. For example, if you made a mistake in
the past and learn from it now, you are using clock time. On the other hand,
if you dwell on it mentally, and self-criticism, remorse, or guilt come up,
then you are making the mistake into “me” and “mine”: you make it part of
your sense of self, and it has become psychological time, which is always
linked to a false sense of identity. Nonforgiveness necessarily implies a
heavy burden of psychological time.
If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using clock time.
You are aware of where you want to go, but you honor and give your fullest
attention to the step that you are taking at this moment. If you then become
excessively focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking
happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no
longer honored. It becomes reduced to a mere stepping stone to the future,
with no intrinsic value. Clock time then turns into psychological time. Your

life's journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to
attain, to “make it.” You no longer see or smell the flowers by the wayside
either, nor are you aware of the beauty and the miracle of life that unfolds
all around you when you are present in the Now.

I can see the supreme importance of the Now, but I cannot quite go
along with you when you say that time is a complete illusion.
When I say “time is an illusion,” my intention is not to make a
philosophical statement. I am just reminding you of a simple fact a fact so
obvious that you may find it hard to grasp and may even find it meaningless
but once fully realized, it can cut like a sword through all the mind-created
layers of complexity and “problems.” Let me say it again: the present
moment is all you ever have. There is never a time when your life is not
“this moment.” Is this not a fact?
