# Acknowledgments
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am deeply thankful to Connie Kellough for her loving support and her vital part in transforming the manuscript into this book and bringing it out into the world. It is a joy to work with her.

I extend my gratitude to Corea Ladner and those wonderful people who have contributed to this book by giving me space, that most precious of gifts space to write and space to be. Thank you to Adrienne Bradley in Vancouver, to Margaret Miller in London and Angie Francesco in Glastonbury, England, Richard in Menlo Park and Rennie Frumkin in Sausalito, California.

I am also thankful to Shirley Spaxman and Howard Kellough for their early review of the manuscript and helpful feedback as well as to those individuals who were kind enough to review the manuscript at a later stage and provide additional input. Thank you to Rose Dendewich for word- processing the manuscript in her unique cheerful and professional manner.

Finally, I would like to express my love and gratitude to my mother and father, without whom this book would not have come into existence, to my spiritual teachers, and to the greatest guru of all: life.

You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold. That is how important you are! Eckhart Tolle
