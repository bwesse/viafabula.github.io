INTRODUCTION

THE ORIGIN OF THIS BOOK
I have little use for the past and rarely think about it; however, I would briefly like to tell you how I came to be a spiritual teacher and how this book came into existence.
Until my thirtieth year, I lived in a state of almost continuous anxiety
interspersed with periods of suicidal depression. It feels now as if I am
talking about some past lifetime or somebody else's life.
One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday, I woke up in the
early hours with a feeling of absolute dread. I had woken up with such a
feeling many times before, but this time it was more intense than it had ever
been. The silence of the night, the vague outlines of the furniture in the dark
room,
the distant noise of a passing train everything felt so alien, so hostile,
and so utterly meaningless that it created in me a deep loathing of the
world. The most loathsome thing of all, however, was my own existence.
What was the point m continuing to live with this burden of misery? Why
carry on with this continuous struggle? I could feel that a deep longing for
annihilation, for nonexistence, was now becoming much stronger than the
instinctive desire to continue to live.
“I cannot live with myself any longer.” This was the thought that kept
repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a
peculiar thought it was. "Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself,
there must be two of me:
the 'I' and the 'self' that 'I' cannot live with.“ ”Maybe,“ I thought, ”only
one of them is real."
I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I
was fully conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn
into what seemed like a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at first
and then accelerated. I was gripped by an intense fear, and my body started
to shake. I heard the words “resist nothing,” as if spoken inside my chest. I
could feel myself being sucked into a void. It felt as if the void was inside
myself rather than outside. Suddenly,
there was no more fear, and I let myself fall into that void. I have no
recollection of what happened after that.
I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I had
never heard such a sound before. My eyes were still closed, and I saw the

image of a precious diamond. Yes, if a diamond could make a sound, this is
what it would be like. I opened my eyes. The first light of dawn was
filtering through the curtains. Without any thought, I felt, I knew, that there
is infinitely more to light than we realize. That soft luminosity filtering
through the curtains was love itself. Tears came into my eyes. I got up and
walked around the room. I recognized the room, and yet I knew that I had
never truly seen it before. Everything was fresh and pristine, as if it had just
come into existence. I picked up things, a pencil, an empty bottle,
marveling at the beauty and aliveness of it all.
That day I walked around the city in utter amazement at the miracle of
life on earth, as if I had just been born into this world.
For the next five months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted deep peace
and bliss. After that, it diminished somewhat in intensity, or perhaps it just
seemed to because it became my natural state. I could still function in the
world, although I realized that nothing I ever did could possibly add
anything to what I already had.
I knew, of course, that something profoundly significant had happened
to me, but I didn't understand it at all. It wasn't until several years later,
after I had read spiritual texts and spent time with spiritual teachers, that I
realized that what everybody was looking for had already happened to me. I
understood that the intense pressure of suffering that night must have forced
my consciousness to withdraw from its identification with the unhappy and
deeply fearful self, which is ultimately a fiction of the mind. This
withdrawal must have been so complete that this false, suffering self
immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled out of an inflatable
toy. What was left then was my true nature as the ever-present I am:
consciousness in its pure state prior to identification with form. Later I also
learned to go into that inner timeless and deathless realm that I had
originally perceived as a void and remain fully conscious. I dwelt in states
of such indescribable bliss and sacredness that even the original experience
I just described pales in comparison. A time came when, for a while, I was
left with nothing on the physical plane. I had no relationships, no job, no
home, no socially defined identity. I spent almost two years sitting on park
benches in a state of the most intense joy.
But even the most beautiful experiences come and go. More
fundamental, perhaps, than any experience is the undercurrent of peace that
has never left me since then. Sometimes it is very strong, almost palpable,
and others can feel it too. At other times, it is somewhere in the
background, like a distant melody.

Later, people would occasionally come up to me and say: “I want what
you have. Can you give it to me, or show me how to get it?” And I would
say: “You have it already. You just can't feel it because your mind is
making too much noise.” That answer later grew into the book that you are
holding in your hands.
Before I knew it, I had an external identity again. I had become a
spiritual teacher.

THE TRUTH THAT IS WITHIN YOU
This book represents the essence of my work, as far as it can be
conveyed in words, with individuals and small groups of spiritual seekers
during the past ten years, in Europe and in North America. In deep love and
appreciation, I would like to thank those exceptional people for their
courage, their willingness to embrace inner change, thought that kept
repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a
peculiar thought it was. “Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself,
there must be two of me: the 'I' and the 'self' that 'I' cannot live with.”
“Maybe,” I thought, “only one of them is real.” their challenging questions,
and their readiness to listen. This book would not have come into existence
without them. They belong to what is as yet a small but fortunately growing
minority of spiritual pioneers: people who are reaching a point where they
become capable of breaking out of inherited collective mind-patterns that
have kept humans in bondage to suffering for eons.
I trust that this book will find its way to those who are ready for such
radical inner transformation and so act as a catalyst for it. I also hope that it
will reach many others who will find its content worthy of consideration,
although they may not be ready to fully live or practice it. It is possible that
at a later time, the seed that was sown when reading this book will merge
with the seed of enlightenment that each human being carries within, and
suddenly that seed will sprout and come alive within them.
The book in its present form originated, often spontaneously, in
response to questions asked by individuals in seminars, meditation classes
and private counseling sessions, and so I have kept the question-and-answer
format. I learned and received as much in those classes and sessions as the
questioners. Some of the questions and answers I wrote down almost
verbatim. Others are generic, which is to say I combined certain types of
questions that were frequently asked into one, and extracted the essence
from different answers to form one generic answer. Sometimes, in the
process of writing, an entirely new answer came that was more profound or
insightful than anything I had ever uttered. Some additional questions were
asked by the editor so as to provide further clarification of certain points.
You will find that from the first to the last page, the

dialogues continuously alternate between two different levels. On one
level, I draw your attention to what is false in you. I speak of the nature of
human unconsciousness and dysfunction as well as its most common
behavioral manifestations, from conflict in relationships to warfare between
tribes or nations. Such knowledge is vital, for unless you learn to recognize
the false as false as not you there can be no lasting transformation, and you
would always end up being drawn back into illusion and into some form of
pain. On this level, I also show you how not to make that which is false in
you into a self and into a personal problem,
for that is how the false perpetuates itself. On another level, I speak of
a profound transformation of human consciousness not as a distant future
possibility, but available now no matter who or where you are. You are
shown how to free yourself from enslavement to the mind, enter into this
enlightened state of consciousness and sustain it in everyday life.
On this level of the book, the words are not always concerned with
information, but often designed to draw you into this new consciousness as
you read. Again and again, I endeavor to take you with me into that
timeless state of intense conscious presence in the Now, so as to give you a
taste of enlightenment. Until you are able to experience what I speak of,
you may find those passages somewhat repetitive. As soon as you do,
however, I believe you will realize that they contain a great deal of spiritual
power, and they may become for you the most rewarding parts of the book.
Moreover, since every person carries the seed of enlightenment within, I
often address myself to the knower in you who dwells behind the thinker,
the deeper self that immediately recognizes spiritual truth, resonates with it,
and gains strength from it.
The pause symbol ¤ after certain passages is a suggestion that you may
want to stop reading for a moment, become still, and feel and experience
the truth of what has just been said. There may be other places in the text
where you will do this naturally and spontaneously.
As you begin reading the book, the meaning of certain words, such as
“Being” or “presence,” may not be entirely clear to you at first. Just read
on. Questions or objections may occasionally come into your mind as you
read. They will probably be answered later in the book, or they may turn
out to be irrelevant as you go more deeply into the teaching and into
yourself.
Don't read with the mind only. Watch out for any “feeling-response”
as you read and a sense of recognition from deep within. I cannot tell you
any spiritual truth that deep within you don't know already. All I can do is

remind you of what you have forgotten. Living knowledge, ancient and yet
ever new, is then activated and released from within every cell of your
body.
The mind always wants to categorize and compare, but this book will
work better for you if you do not attempt to compare its terminology with
that of other teachings; otherwise, you will probably become confused. I
use words such as “mind,” “happiness,” and “consciousness” in ways that
do not necessarily correlate with other teachings. Don't get attached to any
words. They are only stepping stones, to be left behind as quickly as
possible.
When I occasionally quote the words of Jesus or the Buddha, from A
Course in Miracles or from other teachings, I do so not in order to compare,
but to draw your attention to the fact that in essence there is and always has
been only one spiritual teaching, although it comes in many forms. Some of
these forms, such as the ancient religions, have become so overlaid with
extraneous matter that their spiritual essence has become almost completely
obscured by it. To a large extent, therefore, their deeper meaning is no
longer recognized and their transformative power lost. When I quote from
the ancient religions or other teachings, it is to reveal their deeper meaning
and thereby restore their transformative power particularly for those readers
who are followers of these religions or teachings. I say to them: there is no
need to go elsewhere for the truth. Let me show you how to go more deeply
into what you already have.
Mostly, however, I have endeavored to use terminology that is as
neutral as possible in order to reach a wide range of people. This book can
be seen as a restatement for our time of that one timeless spiritual teaching,
the essence of all religions. It is not derived from external sources, but from
the one true Source within, so it contains no theory or speculation. I speak
from inner experience, and if at times I speak forcefully, it is to cut through
heavy layers of mental resistance and to reach that place within you where
you already know, just as I know, and where the truth is recognized when it
is heard. There is then a feeling of exaltation and heightened aliveness, as
something within you says: “Yes. I know this is true.”
