The Hare often shows off his speed, leaping streams and roots and laughing at anyone behind him.
His pride grows with each run, and he enjoys the attention.
One morning he shouts that nothing can beat him, not even time itself.

The forest listens to his loud claims.
Some are impressed, but others grow tired of his boasting.
