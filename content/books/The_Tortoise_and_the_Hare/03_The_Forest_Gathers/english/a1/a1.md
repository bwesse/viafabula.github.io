News of the race spreads through the forest.
Birds perch on branches, squirrels line the path, and even the old owl blinks awake to see.
Most think the Hare will win, but they still want to watch.

The Tortoise waits at the track, calm and steady.
The Hare bounces with pride, happy to perform for the crowd.
