The Fox, respected for being fair, volunteers to judge and draws a neat starting line.
The Tortoise positions himself with patient care, breathing evenly.
The Hare coils with energy, ready to dash the moment he hears the call.

Around them, the forest crowds in, tense with expectation.
All eyes fix on the line in the dirt.
