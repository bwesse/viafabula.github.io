The Tortoise keeps to the course with a steady rhythm—slow, even, unflinching.
He passes trees, stones, and flowers, all with the same quiet drive.
When he reaches the Hare asleep in the sun, he ghosts by without a sound.

He does not pause to savor the moment; he simply continues toward the finish.
