Don't Criticize, Condemn, or Complain

Do not say bad things about people.
Do not complain.
Be nice instead.

When you criticize people, they feel bad.
They do not like you.
They do not listen to you.

Be kind to everyone.
Say good things.
Help others feel happy.

This makes people like you more.
This makes your life better too.
Start being kind today.
