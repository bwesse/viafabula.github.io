Don't Criticize, Condemn, or Complain

Criticism is fundamentally futile because it puts people on the defensive and usually makes them strive to justify themselves. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts their sense of importance, and arouses resentment.

The famous psychologist B.F. Skinner proved through his research that animals rewarded for good behavior learn much faster than animals punished for bad behavior. The same principle applies to humans. Criticism doesn't lead to lasting change - it creates resentment and resistance.

Dale Carnegie shares the story of Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot. Once, after performing at an air show, his plane's engines suddenly stopped working at three hundred feet in the air. Through skillful maneuvering, Hoover managed to land the plane, but it was badly damaged. The immediate cause turned out to be the wrong fuel in his plane.

When Hoover confronted the mechanic who serviced his plane, the man was already devastated. He had just made a terrible mistake that could have cost three lives. Hoover didn't scold the man. Instead, he put his arm around his shoulder and said, "To show you I'm sure you'll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow."

This story illustrates the power of not criticizing. The mechanic learned his lesson without being crushed by harsh words. He surely never made that mistake again, and he developed deep loyalty and respect for Hoover.

History provides countless examples. Abraham Lincoln, early in his career, loved to criticize and ridicule his opponents. He wrote insulting letters and even published poems mocking his political enemies. This created lifelong enemies. After one particularly harsh letter nearly led to a sword duel, Lincoln learned his lesson. He never again publicly criticized anyone, even during the immense pressure of the Civil War.

Benjamin Franklin attributed his tremendous influence over others to his policy of speaking ill of no one. Theodore Roosevelt said, "The best executive is one who has sense enough to pick good people to do what he wants done, and self-restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it."

To implement this principle effectively:
- Pause before criticizing and ask yourself if it will really help
- Consider the other person's perspective and motivations  
- Remember that criticism rarely leads to improvement
- Focus on encouragement and appreciation instead
- Understand that people act from their own point of view, not yours

Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving. As Dr. Johnson said, "God himself does not propose to judge man until the end of his days." So why should you and I?
