Don't Criticize, Condemn, or Complain

This foundational principle of human relations rests on a profound psychological truth: criticism is utterly futile because it puts people on the defensive and usually makes them strive to justify themselves. More dangerously, criticism wounds a person's precious pride, hurts their sense of importance, and arouses lasting resentment.

The renowned behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner conducted extensive research demonstrating that animals rewarded for good behavior learn significantly faster and retain knowledge longer than animals punished for bad behavior. This principle holds true for human beings as well. When dealing with people, we must remember that we're not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

Historical figures who achieved greatness invariably learned this lesson. Consider Abraham Lincoln, who evolved dramatically in his approach to others. In his youth, Lincoln loved sharp debate and public ridicule. He wrote insulting letters to opponents and published anonymous poems mocking his enemies in the local newspaper. One particularly caustic letter, published when Lincoln was twenty-three, insulted a vain Irish politician named James Shields. The letter ridiculed Shields so thoroughly that he challenged Lincoln to a duel with cavalry broadswords.

Lincoln accepted the challenge and chose broadswords because his long arms would give him an advantage. On the day of the duel, at the last possible moment, their seconds intervened and stopped the fight. This close brush with death profoundly changed Lincoln. From that day forward, he never wrote another insulting letter. He never again publicly criticized anyone for anything.

During the Civil War, Lincoln demonstrated remarkable restraint in the face of incompetent generals. After the disastrous Battle of Gettysburg, General Meade failed to pursue Lee's retreating army, missing a golden opportunity to end the war. Lincoln wrote Meade a letter expressing his profound disappointment. However, Lincoln never sent the letter. He had learned that sharp criticism would only make Meade defensive and resentful, potentially making him a less effective commander.

The letter was found among Lincoln's papers after his death. This incident perfectly illustrates Lincoln's evolved philosophy: understanding and forgiveness accomplish far more than criticism and condemnation.

Benjamin Franklin, one of the most diplomatic and influential Americans in history, attributed his tremendous success in dealing with people to his policy never to speak ill of anyone. He wrote in his autobiography: "I will speak ill of no man, and speak all the good I know of everybody." This simple policy transformed Franklin from a brash young printer into a diplomat who successfully negotiated France's critical support for American independence.

Theodore Roosevelt understood this principle from a different angle. He said, "The best executive is one who has sense enough to pick good people to do what he wants done, and self-restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it." Roosevelt recognized that constant criticism and interference undermine people's confidence and initiative.

Why do we criticize despite these clear warnings from history and psychology? Usually, criticism serves our ego more than any constructive purpose. When we criticize, we temporarily feel superior. We assert our intelligence and judgment. But these momentary ego satisfactions come at an enormous cost in damaged relationships and diminished influence.

The psychologist Hans Selye observed that people have a deep need to feel appreciated and important. Criticism attacks this fundamental need. Even criminals rarely think of themselves as bad people. Al Capone, one of America's most notorious criminals, considered himself a benefactor to society. Dutch Schultz, another infamous gangster, believed he was a public benefactor. If criminals see themselves in such positive terms, what hope do we have that ordinary people will accept criticism gracefully?

To implement this principle requires constant self-awareness and discipline:

First, when you feel the impulse to criticize, pause and examine your true motivation. Are you genuinely trying to help the other person improve, or are you satisfying your own ego?

Second, consider the inevitable consequences. Will your criticism actually lead to positive change, or will it merely create defensiveness and resentment?

Third, try to see the situation from the other person's perspective. People act from their own point of view, not yours. They have reasons for their behavior that make sense to them.

Fourth, remember that criticism rarely leads to lasting improvement. People change themselves when they're motivated from within, not when they're attacked from without.

Fifth, practice looking for things to appreciate rather than criticize. This shift in perspective transforms not only how others see you, but how you experience life.

The German poet Goethe wisely noted, "I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again."

Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving. As Dr. Samuel Johnson observed, "God himself does not propose to judge man until the end of his days." If even divine judgment is deferred, surely we imperfect humans should show humility and restraint in judging others.

This principle doesn't mean you should never provide feedback or address problems. Rather, it means approaching situations with understanding, empathy, and a focus on solutions rather than blame. In the next chapters, we'll explore positive alternatives to criticism that actually work to influence people and improve situations.
