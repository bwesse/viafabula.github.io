This chapter focuses on Robert explains the fundamental differences between his two dads and their contrasting philosophies about work, money, and success.

Robert learned early that there are two ways to approach money. His poor dad believed in getting a good education and working for a secure company. His rich dad taught him that you should learn to have money work for you instead.

The key difference between rich and poor is how they think about money and assets. Rich people build assets that generate income, while middle-class people often buy liabilities thinking they are assets. Understanding this distinction is crucial for financial success.
