Getting Started

Ten steps to awaken your financial genius and start building wealth.

Robert Kiyosaki learned about money from two very different men - his real father and his best friend's father. His own dad was smart and well-educated, working as a high-level education official in Hawaii. He followed the traditional path: study hard, get good grades, land a secure job with benefits, and work your way up. Despite this solid resume and steady paycheck, he constantly struggled with money and never achieved real financial security.

His best friend Mike's dad, on the other hand, never made it past eighth grade. But this man - whom Robert calls his 'rich dad' - became one of Hawaii's wealthiest entrepreneurs. He had figured out something crucial that schools don't teach: how money actually works, and how to make it work for you rather than spending your whole life working for it.

The contrast between these two mentors gave Robert a unique perspective on wealth. He watched his poor dad work harder and harder, get promotions and raises, yet somehow fall further behind financially each year. Meanwhile, his rich dad seemed to work less and less while his wealth grew - his businesses and investments were doing the heavy lifting for him.

This chapter explores why one educated, hardworking man struggled financially while another, with less formal education, thrived. The answer wasn't about how much money they made - it was about financial literacy and their fundamental understanding of how money works. It was about whether they were working for money, or had learned to make money work for them.

These lessons, learned over thirty years from his rich dad, completely transformed Robert's financial life. And he believes they can transform yours too. Because at their core, they're not complex investment strategies or get-rich-quick schemes. They're fundamental principles about how wealthy people think about money differently than poor and middle-class people. They're about challenging the conventional wisdom most of us absorbed growing up, and opening our minds to different possibilities about what's financially possible.
