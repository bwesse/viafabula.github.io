This book is about two fathers who taught the author very different lessons about money and success.

His poor dad was highly educated and worked for the government. He believed in studying hard, getting good grades, and finding a secure job. Despite his education, he struggled with money his whole life.

His rich dad never finished school but built a business empire. He taught the author how money really works and how to make it work for you instead of working for it.

The author learned that financial education is more important than academic education. These lessons helped him become wealthy and he wants to share them with readers who want to escape the "rat race" and achieve financial freedom.
