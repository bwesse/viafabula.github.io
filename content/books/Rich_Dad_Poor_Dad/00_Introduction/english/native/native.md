Robert Kiyosaki's journey to financial literacy began with an unusual advantage: he had two dads. Not literally, but he learned from two father figures who couldn't have been more different in their approach to money and success.

His "poor dad" was his biological father – a brilliant, highly educated man with a Ph.D. who rose to become the head of Hawaii's education system. He believed in the traditional path: study hard, get good grades, find a secure job with benefits, and work your way up the corporate ladder. Despite his impressive resume and steady paycheck, he struggled with money throughout his life, living paycheck to paycheck and accumulating debt. He'd often say things like "I can't afford it" or "Money doesn't matter."

His "rich dad" was his best friend Mike's father, who never finished the eighth grade but went on to become one of the wealthiest men in Hawaii. He had a completely different philosophy about money. He believed in financial education, understanding assets and liabilities, making money work for you rather than working for money, and building wealth through investments and business ownership. He'd challenge Robert by asking "How can you afford it?" instead of simply declaring something unaffordable.

Growing up with these two contrasting perspectives created a unique lens through which Robert viewed money. He watched his poor dad work harder and harder, get raises and promotions, yet somehow fall further behind financially. Meanwhile, his rich dad seemed to work less and less as his businesses and investments grew, generating income even when he wasn't actively working.

The stark difference between these two mentors forced Robert to think critically about conventional wisdom regarding money. Why did one educated, hardworking man struggle while another, less formally educated man prospered? The answer, he discovered, lay not in how much money they made but in their financial literacy – their understanding of how money works.

This book shares the lessons Robert learned from his rich dad over thirty years, lessons that transformed his own life and financial trajectory. These aren't get-rich-quick schemes or complex investment strategies. Instead, they're fundamental principles about how wealthy people think about money differently than poor and middle-class people. They're about challenging the conventional wisdom that's been drilled into most of us since childhood and opening our minds to different possibilities.

Robert wrote this book because he believes financial education is critically lacking in our schools and homes. Most people learn to work for money but never learn how to make money work for them. They're taught to be good employees but not how to be investors or business owners. They understand how to spend money but not how to build assets that generate passive income.

Through the lessons of his rich dad, Robert hopes to provide readers with the financial education they never received in school, helping them break free from the "rat race" of working for money and instead achieve financial independence where their assets work for them. Whether you're just starting your career or well into it, whether you're struggling financially or doing okay but wanting more, these lessons offer a different way of thinking about money, work, and wealth that just might change your financial future.
