Robert Kiyosaki had two influential fathers who shaped his understanding of money and wealth creation. His biological father, whom he calls his "poor dad," was a highly educated man with a Ph.D. who worked as the head of education in Hawaii. Despite his impressive credentials and stable government job, he constantly struggled financially and lived paycheck to paycheck.

His best friend Mike's father, his "rich dad," dropped out of school at thirteen but went on to become one of the wealthiest men in Hawaii. This man taught Robert lessons about money that he never learned in school – lessons about assets, liabilities, and how the rich think differently about wealth.

The contrast between these two father figures became the foundation for Robert's financial education. His poor dad would say, "The love of money is the root of all evil," while his rich dad would say, "The lack of money is the root of all evil." His poor dad encouraged him to study hard to find a good company to work for, while his rich dad encouraged him to study hard to find a good company to buy.

This book shares the lessons Robert learned from his rich dad, lessons that challenged conventional wisdom about money and opened his path to financial independence. He wrote this book to help others break free from the traditional mindset about work and money and to provide a different perspective on achieving financial security.
