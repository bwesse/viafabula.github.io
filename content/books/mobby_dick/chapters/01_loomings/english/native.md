My name is Ishmael. Years ago, when my pockets were nearly empty and nothing on land held my interest, I decided to go to sea and spend some time among the watery parts of the world. The ocean has always had a way of clearing my head when my thoughts start turning dark.

Whenever I feel myself slipping into a kind of inner November—when life seems dim, when I pause too long outside places connected to death—I know it’s time to leave the land behind. Going to sea is my way of keeping myself balanced. Other people might choose something drastic or destructive, but I’ve learned that simply stepping onto a ship is enough for me. And if most people looked honestly at themselves, they’d find they feel something similar toward the ocean.

Take New York City: an island wrapped in piers like a tropical isle bound in coral. Its streets pull you toward the harbor, and at the southern tip the waves slap the seawall while a cool wind blows in from far off. Crowds gather there for no other reason than to watch the water.

Walk through the city on a quiet Sunday afternoon and look around. Everywhere, men are facing the ocean: leaning against posts, sitting on the ends of docks, staring from the decks of ships from China, or climbing high into the rigging for a better view. These are men who spend their entire week shut inside shops and offices, yet on their one free day they are drawn to the sea. What pulls them here? What calls them?

You see the same thing inland. Wander through almost any countryside and sooner or later the path drops toward a lake or a stream. People drift toward water almost without thinking, even when their minds are far away. Water and reflection have always been intertwined.

Artists understand this instinctively. When a painter wants to create the most peaceful, haunting, or romantic landscape imaginable, water is the element that completes it. Without water, the picture feels unfinished. Think of Niagara Falls—if it were nothing but tumbling sand, no one would travel thousands of miles to see it. Many boys grow up dreaming of the sea. And on your first voyage, when the land finally disappears, you feel a strange, electric mix of fear and wonder. Ancient peoples treated the ocean as sacred and gave it its own gods. Stories often tie water to life’s deepest mysteries. One tells of a man who drowned trying to touch the reflection he saw in a pool—an image he could never reach. Water reveals the things we desire but can never grasp.

When I say I go to sea whenever I feel unsettled, I don’t mean I go as a passenger. Passengers pay for the privilege, get seasick, complain constantly, and rarely enjoy the journey. Nor do I go as a captain or a cook. I have no desire to shoulder all the responsibilities of running a ship. Managing myself is enough work.

I go as a simple sailor. Officers shout orders, and at first it feels jarring, especially if you once came from a respected family or held a job where you told others what to do. Going from giving commands to following them is quite a shift. But with time, the sting fades.

If the captain tells me to sweep the deck, I sweep the deck. It doesn’t injure my pride. Everyone answers to someone; life pushes all of us around in its own way. Accepting that makes the work lighter.

There’s also the practical matter that sailors are paid for their trouble, while passengers pay for theirs. And there’s a world of difference between handing over money and receiving it.

I enjoy the clean wind at the bow of the ship. The captain back on the quarterdeck thinks he’s breathing the freshest air, but it reaches him only after moving over us first. Life often works that way: ordinary people go ahead of the so-called leaders without them even realizing it.

But why, after many ordinary voyages, did I suddenly feel compelled to join a whaling expedition? I can’t fully explain it. Maybe it was fate, part of some old design drawn up long before I was born. Maybe it was the mystery of the great whale itself—a creature so enormous and powerful it seized my imagination. The remote seas it roams, the danger surrounding it, the strange beauty of that world—all of it fascinated me. I’ve always been drawn to distant places and unsettling wonders.

So the idea of a whaling voyage felt right. It opened a door into a world of marvels. In my mind, I saw endless lines of whales drifting through the deep, and at the center of them all, one vast white shape, rising like a ghostly mountain of snow suspended in the air.
