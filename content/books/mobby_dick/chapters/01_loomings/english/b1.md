My name is Ishmael. Some years ago, I had little money and nothing on land that truly interested me. So I decided to go to sea for a while and explore the watery part of the world. The ocean helps me clear my mind when I feel low or restless.

Whenever I notice myself becoming gloomy, or when my thoughts feel heavy and dark, or when I start stopping in front of places connected with death, I know it is time for me to leave land and go back to the sea. This is how I keep myself balanced. Other people may choose dangerous or dramatic ways to escape their problems, but I simply choose a ship. And if they understood themselves better, many men would realize they share a similar feeling toward the ocean.

Look at New York City. It is an island surrounded by water, with piers all around it. The streets lead directly to the harbor. At the southern end, waves break against the land, and cool sea wind flows in from far away. Many people gather there just to watch the water.

Walk around the city on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Go from one end to the other. Everywhere you look, you will see people staring at the sea—leaning on posts, sitting on the pier, looking from the decks of foreign ships, or climbing up the ropes to get a better view. These people normally work indoors all week. But on their free days, they come to the ocean. Why? What makes the sea so powerful to them?

More and more people walk straight toward the water, as if drawn by something invisible. They want to stand at the very edge of the land, as close to the waves as possible without falling in. They come from every direction—north, south, east, and west. Yet all of them meet here at the water. Is the sea pulling them in some mysterious way?

The same thing happens in the countryside. No matter which path you take, it often leads down to a lake or a small stream. People naturally move toward water, even when they are lost in their thoughts. If you ever get stuck in a desert, follow a deep thinker—he might unknowingly lead you to water. Water and reflection seem permanently connected.

Artists understand this deeply. When a painter wants to show the most peaceful and beautiful landscape, he includes trees, fields, mountains, animals—but above all, water. Without water, the scene feels incomplete. Think of Niagara Falls—if it were only falling sand, no one would travel far to see it. Many boys dream of going to sea. When you take your first journey and the land disappears, you feel a strange and powerful excitement. Ancient cultures saw the sea as holy and gave it their own gods. There are many stories linking water to the mysteries of life. One tells of a man who fell into a pool trying to touch his own reflection, something he could never reach. Water often shows us the part of life that is beautiful but unreachable.

When I say I go to sea when I feel troubled, I do not mean I go as a passenger. Passengers must pay money, they get sick, they complain, and they hardly enjoy the trip. I also do not go as a captain or a cook. I do not want to carry responsibility or deal with the problems of a whole ship. Taking care of myself is enough.

I go like an ordinary sailor. The officers give me orders, and at first it feels strange, especially if you come from a respected family or have worked as a teacher. It is a sharp change to go from giving orders to taking them. But soon you adapt.

If the captain asks me to sweep the deck, I simply do it. I don't feel insulted. Everyone must follow orders in one form or another; life pushes all of us around at times. Knowing this makes it easier to accept.

Another reason I choose to be a sailor is that sailors get paid. Passengers must pay instead. It is always better to receive money than to hand it out.

I also enjoy the healthy exercise and fresh air at the front of the ship. The captain, standing at the back, often thinks he breathes the freshest air, but actually he receives it after it has passed over the sailors. Life is often like this: ordinary people guide things more than leaders realize.

But why, after many normal sea trips, did I suddenly want to join a whaling voyage? I cannot fully explain it. Perhaps it was fate, something written long ago. Perhaps it was the great mystery of the whale itself. The idea of ​​such a huge and powerful creature stirred my imagination. The distant, wild seas where it travels excites me. The dangers of whales and their world seemed almost magical. I am always drawn to faraway places and strange experiences.

So the whaling journey felt right to me. It opened the door to a world of wonder. In my mind I saw endless lines of whales, and among them one great white shape, tall and silent like a mountain of snow hanging in the sky.
