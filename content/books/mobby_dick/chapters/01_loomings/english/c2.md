My name is Ishmael. Years ago, when my money was nearly gone and the land offered me nothing but boredom, I decided to go to sea and discover again the watery part of the world. The ocean has always cleared my mind when my thoughts grow heavy.

Whenever I feel myself sinking into gloom, whenever life seems bleak and I catch myself pausing before places connected with death, I know it is time to leave the land. Going to sea is my way of restoring balance. Others may choose more violent or theatrical escapes, but I choose a ship. And if most people understood their own inner lives more honestly, they would realize they feel something similar toward the sea.

Consider New York City—an island ringed with piers, its streets directing you toward the harbor. At the southern tip, waves break against the shore and the wind arrives from far beyond sight. People gather there simply to look at the water.

Walk through the city on a quiet Sunday. Everywhere you go, men are facing the sea: leaning on posts, sitting on the edge of the pier, staring from the decks of distant ships, or climbing up the rigging to catch a wider view. These are men who spend their weekdays locked inside shops and offices, yet on their free days they come to the ocean. What draws them so powerfully to it?

More people move steadily toward the shoreline, as if responding to a call. They walk to the limit of the land and stand as close to the water as they can without falling in. They come from every direction and meet at the same border where land ends. The sea seems to exert a quiet, irresistible pull.

You see the same thing in the countryside. Most paths eventually lead to some body of water—a stream, a pond, a lake. People drift toward water almost instinctively, even when lost in thought. Water and reflection appear permanently intertwined.

Artists know this well. When a painter wants to create the most serene or enchanting landscape, water is the element that completes the scene. Without it, the image feels empty. Think of Niagara Falls—if it were a cascade of sand, no one would travel thousands of miles to see it. Many young men dream of the sea. On your first voyage, when the shore fades from sight, you feel a strange mixture of awe, fear, and freedom. Ancient cultures treated the sea as sacred and gave it its own gods. Myths often connect water with the deeper mysteries of life. One story tells of a man who drowned trying to touch his own reflection—an image he could never grasp. Water often reveals what we long for but cannot hold.

When I say I go to sea when my mind grows troubled, I do not mean I travel as a passenger. Passengers must pay, they get seasick, they complain, and they rarely enjoy their journey. Nor do I go as a captain or a cook. I have no wish to carry the burdens and responsibilities of command. Managing myself is demanding enough.

I go as an ordinary sailor. Officers give me orders, and at first it feels harsh, especially if you once came from a respected position on land. It is a jarring shift to go from giving commands to obeying them. But in time you adapt.

If a captain tells me to sweep the deck, I do it. It does not wound my pride. Everyone, in some form, must answer to someone; life pushes all of us. Accepting this makes the work easier.

Another reason is simple: sailors are paid, passengers pay. The difference between the two is enormous.

I enjoy the strong wind and clean air at the front of the ship. The captain at the rear believes he breathes the purest air, but it reaches him only after passing over us. Life often works like that: ordinary people lead the way without being recognized.

But why, after many ordinary voyages, did I feel compelled to join a whaling ship? I cannot fully explain it. Perhaps it was fate, part of a larger design written long before I was born. Perhaps it was the mystery of the great whale, a creature so vast and powerful it overwhelmed my imagination. The remote seas where it travels, the danger surrounding it, and the strange beauty of that world fascinated me. I have always been drawn to distant places and unsettling wonders.

So the idea of a whaling voyage felt necessary. It opened a door into a realm of marvels. In my mind I saw endless processions of whales, and among them one towering white form, rising like a silent mountain of snow in the open air.
