My name is Ishmael.
Some years ago, I had no money.
I was not happy on land.
So I went to the sea.
The sea helps me feel better.

When I feel sad, I go to the sea.
When my mind feels dark, I go to the sea.
The sea makes me calm.

Many people like the sea.
In New York City, many people look at the water.
They stand by the water.
They sit by the water.
They want to be close to the sea.

In the country it is the same.
Many paths go to water.
People walk to lakes and rivers.
Water makes people think.
Water makes people feel still.

Artists like water too.
Water makes pictures beautiful.

I do not go to the sea as a passenger.
Passengers pay money.
Passengers get sick.
I don't want that.

I go like a sailor.
Sailors working on the ship.
Sailors get money.
This is better for me.

The sea air is good.
The work is hard, but it is okay.
Everyone must follow orders sometimes.

Why do I go on a whaling ship?
I do not know exactly.
Maybe it is fate.
Maybe it is the great whale.
The whale is big and strange.
The far ocean calls me.

So I go.
I want to see the whale.
In my mind, I see many whales.
And one big white whale, like a mountain in the sky.
