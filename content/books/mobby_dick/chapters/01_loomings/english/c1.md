My name is Ishmael. Some years ago, when I had little money and nothing on land that truly interested me, I decided to go to sea and explore the watery part of the world. Being at sea helps me clear my thoughts when I feel troubled or restless.

Whenever I feel myself becoming dark in mood, when life seems heavy and I catch myself lingering near places connected with death, I know it is time to return to the ocean. This is how I steady myself. Others might choose more dramatic or dangerous escapes, but I simply choose a ship. And if most people understood their own feelings better, they would realize they share something similar toward the sea.

Look at New York City, an island surrounded by water and lined with piers. The streets lead you toward the harbor, and at the southern edge the waves wash against the land and bring cool air from far out at sea. Crowds gather there just to watch the water.

Walk through the city on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Everywhere you go, you see men staring at the ocean: leaning on posts, sitting on the pier, looking from the decks of distant ships, or climbing high into the rigging for a better view. They spend their weekdays shut inside shops and offices, yet on their free days they come to the sea. What draws them here? Why do they all end up facing the water?

More people come walking straight toward the shoreline, as if pulled by something invisible. They stand at the very edge of the land, wanting to be as close to the waves as possible without falling in. They come from every direction, yet they all meet at the water's edge. It is as if the sea exerts a quiet force on them.

You can see the same thing in the countryside. Most paths eventually lead down to a lake or a river. People drift toward water almost without noticing it, even when lost in thought. Water and contemplation seem naturally linked.

Artists understand this deeply. When a painter wants to create the most peaceful and enchanting landscape, water is the essential element. Without it, the scene feels incomplete. Think of Niagara Falls: if it were only falling sand, no one would travel far to see it. Many boys dream of going to sea, and on your first voyage, when land disappears, you feel a strange mix of excitement and fear. Ancient cultures treated the sea as sacred. Many stories connect water with the mysteries of life. One tells of a man who tried to touch his own reflection and drowned, unable to grasp what he saw. Water often shows us the unreachable parts of ourselves.

When I say I go to sea when I feel unsettled, I do not mean like a passenger. Passengers pay to be on board, they become seasick, they complain, and they rarely enjoy themselves. I also do not go as a captain or a cook. I do not want the responsibility of running a ship. Taking care of myself is quite enough.

I go like an ordinary sailor. Officers give me orders, and at first it feels uncomfortable, especially if you once belonged to a respected family or worked as a teacher. Going from giving commands to following them is a sharp shift. But soon the discomfort fades.

If the captain asks me to sweep the deck, I simply do it. It does not insult my pride. Everyone follows commands in one way or another; life pushes us all. Accepting that makes obedience easier.

Another reason is simple: sailors are paid. Passengers pay. And there is a great difference between paying and being paid.

I enjoy the exercise and the fresh air at the front of the ship. The captain at the rear thinks he breathes the purest air, but in truth it reaches him only after passing over the sailors. Life works like that: ordinary people often lead without being recognized.

But why did I suddenly choose a whaling voyage after many ordinary trips? I cannot fully explain it. Perhaps it was fate, part of a larger plan written long ago. Perhaps it was the mystery of the great whale, a creature so huge and powerful that it captured my imagination. The distant seas where it travels, the dangers surrounding it, and the strange beauty of that world all fascinated me. I am drawn to remote places and unusual experiences.

So the whaling voyage felt right. It opened a doorway into a world of wonder. In my mind I saw endless lines of whales, and among them one enormous white shape, towering like a mountain of snow suspended in the air.
