My name is Ishmael. Some years ago, I had very little money. I had nothing to do on land. So I wanted to go on a ship and see the water of the world. When I feel sad or tired, going to the sea helps me feel better.

When I feel unhappy, or when my heart feels dark, or when I stop and look too long at places for dead people, I know it is time to go to the sea. This is my way to stay safe and calm. Other people do different things, but I go on a ship. Many people feel the same, even if they don't say it.

Here is New York City. Water is all around it. The streets go to the water. In the south of the city, the waves hit the land. Many people look at the sea there.

Walk around the city on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Go from one end to the other. What do you see? Many men stand and look at the ocean. Some lean on wood. Some sit on the pier. Some look over the sides of ships from China. Some climb high to see more water. These men work inside buildings all week. But still they come to the sea. Why? Where are the green fields? Why do they all come here?

More people walk to the water. They stop at the very edge of the land. They don't want to fall in, but they want to be close. Many people eat from every place in the city. Why? Is the sea calling them?

If you go to the countryside, you will see the same. Any path you take will often lead to a lake or a small river. People always go to water without thinking. Water and thinking go together.

Here is an artist. He wants to paint a quiet, beautiful place. What do I need? Trees, grass, animals, mountains—and water. Without water, the picture is not complete. Water makes places special. Think of a big waterfall. If it was only falling sand, no one would go to see it. Many people love the sea. Boys dream about going to the sea. On your first ship trip, you feel something special when land disappears. Long ago, people thought the sea was holy. The sea is important in many stories. One story says a man saw his own face in the water and wanted to touch it, but he couldn't. So he fell in. The water showed him something he could not reach. Water shows us the mystery of life.

When I say I go to the sea when I feel bad, I do not mean I go as a passenger. Passengers must pay money. They also get sick and grumpy. I do not enjoy that. I also do not go as a captain or cook. I do not want important jobs. It is hard enough to take care of myself. I don't want to take care of a ship too.

I go as a simple sailor. They tell me what to do. At first it feels strange. If you were a school teacher before, it feels very different to be ordered around. But after some time, it becomes normal.

If a captain tells me to sweep the deck, it is fine. It does not hurt my honor. Everyone in the world must follow someone in some way. We all work and get pushed a little. That is life.

I also go like a sailor because they pay me. Passengers must pay, sailors get money. Getting paid feels good. Paying does not.

I like the sea air and the movement of the ship. It is healthy. The people on top of the ship think they get the fresh air first, but they don't. They get it after the sailors breathe it. This is like many things in life.

But why did I want to go on a whaling ship this time? I cannot tell you exactly. Maybe it was fate. Maybe it was part of a big plan. Maybe it was something strange inside me. The idea of ​​the great whale was exciting. The far, wild seas called to me. The dangers made me curious. I always want to see far places. I like strange lands and strange things. I want to understand them.

So the whaling trip felt right. It opened a big door of wonder for me. In my mind, I saw many whales, one after another, and one great white shape above them all, like a snowy mountain in the sky.
