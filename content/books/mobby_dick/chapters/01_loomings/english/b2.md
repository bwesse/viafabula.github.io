My name is Ishmael. Some years ago, when I had very little money and nothing on land that truly held my interest, I decided to go to sea for a while and explore the watery part of the world. Being at sea helps me clear my mind; it lifts my mood when I feel troubled or heavy-hearted.

Whenever I notice myself becoming gloomy—when life feels gray and I start pausing in front of places connected to death—I know it is time to return to the ocean. This is how I protect my spirit. Others may choose more dangerous escapes, but my simple remedy is to go aboard a ship. And truly, if they understood themselves better, many people would realize they feel something similar toward the sea.

Take New York City, for example—an island surrounded by water, its edges lined with piers like a tropical island with coral reefs. The streets point toward the harbor, and at the southern tip, the waves wash against the land and the cool sea breeze arrives from far away. Crowds gather simply to look at the water.

Walk around the city on a calm Sunday afternoon. Go from one end to the other. Everywhere you turn, you find men staring at the ocean—leaning on posts, sitting on the pier, looking from the decks of ships from China, or climbing the rigging to catch a better view. These men spend their weekdays shut inside shops and offices, yet on their days of rest they come to the sea. Why? What draws them here?

Watch even more people walking straight toward the water, almost as if something pulls them forward. They move to the very edge of the land, as close to the waves as possible without falling in. They come from every part of the city—north, south, east, and west—and all meet at the same border where land ends. Is the sea attracting them with some invisible force?

You see the same effect in the countryside. In almost any region, if you follow a path, chances are high it will eventually lead you to a lake, a river, or a small stream. People naturally drift toward water, even when lost in their thoughts. Water and reflection seem to belong together.

Artists understand this well. When a painter wants to create a peaceful, romantic landscape, he uses trees, fields, mountains, and animals—but water is the essential element. Without it, the scene feels empty. Consider Niagara Falls: if it were only falling sand, no one would travel far to see it. Many boys dream of going to sea, and on your first voyage, when the shore disappears, you feel a strange mix of fear and excitement. Ancient cultures considered the sea holy and gave it divine power. Stories often link water with the mysteries of life. One tale speaks of a man who fell into a pool trying to touch his own reflection—an image he could never grasp. Water shows us the unreachable parts of our lives.

When I say I go to sea when I feel unsettled, I do not mean I travel as a passenger. Passengers must pay, they get sick, they argue, they sleep poorly, and they rarely enjoy the trip. I also never go as a captain or a cook. I do not want the responsibilities or the stress that comes with those positions. Looking after myself is enough.

I go like an ordinary sailor. Officers give me orders, and at first it feels uncomfortable, especially if you once belonged to a respected family or worked as a teacher. It is a sharp transition to go from giving commands to obeying them. But after some time, the feeling fades.

If the captain tells me to sweep the deck, I do it. It does not damage my pride. Everyone follows commands in some form; life pushes us all in different ways. Knowing this makes the work easier to accept.

Another practical reason: sailors get paid. Passengers pay to be on board; sailors receive wages. And there is a world of difference between paying and being paid.

I also enjoy the exercise and fresh air at the front of the ship. The captain, standing at the back, thinks he breathes the freshest air, but in truth, it reaches him only after passing over the sailors. Life often works like that—ordinary people lead the way without the leaders realizing it.

But why did I suddenly want to join a whaling ship after many ordinary voyages? I cannot fully explain it. Perhaps it was fate—a part of some larger plan. Perhaps it was the mystery of the great whale itself, a creature so enormous and powerful that it filled my imagination. The distant seas where it travelled, the dangers of the hunt, and the strange beauty of that world all fascinated me. I have always been drawn to remote places and unusual experiences.

So the idea of ​​a whaling voyage felt right. It opened the gates to a world of wonder. In my mind, endless lines of whales moved through the deep, and among them rose one enormous white shape—silent, towering, like a mountain of snow hanging in the air.
