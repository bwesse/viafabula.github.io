My name is Ishmael. Some years ago, I didn't have much money, and nothing on land felt interesting to me. So I decided to go on a ship for a while and see the water of the world. Going to sea helps me when I feel sad or tired in my mind.

Whenever I feel unhappy, or my thoughts become dark, or when I find myself stopping in front of places connected to death, I know it is time for me to go to the sea. This is my way to stay calm and to take care of myself. I do not use weapons or dangerous things. I simply go on a ship. Many people, if they understood themselves better, would discover that they feel something similar about the ocean.

Here you can see New York City, an island surrounded by water. The streets lead you toward the harbor. At the south end, the waves touch the land, and cool wind comes from the sea. Many people stand there, watching the water.

Walk through the city on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Go from one side to the other. What do you see? Everywhere, many men stand and look at the ocean. Some read against wooden posts. Some sit on the pier. Some look from the sides of ships from China. Others climb into the ropes above the deck to see even further. These men usually work inside buildings all week, but still they come to the sea. Why is that? Where are the open fields? What brings them here?

Look again. More people are walking straight to the water, almost as if they want to jump in. They want to stand at the very edge of the land. They come from every part of the city—north, south, east, and west. They all meet here at the water. Is something pulling them toward it?

If you go to the countryside, you can see the same thing. Almost every path will lead you to some lake or small river. People naturally go toward water, even when they are deep in their thoughts. If you ever get lost in a desert, try following the person who thinks a lot—he might walk toward water without knowing it. Water and thinking always seem to go together.

Artists know this too. When a painter wants to create a peaceful and beautiful picture, he uses trees, grass, mountains, and animals—but he also needs water. Without water, the picture feels empty. Think about famous places: a waterfall made of sand would not interest anyone. Many boys dream of going to sea. On your first voyage, you feel something special when the land disappears. Ancient people also believed the sea was holy. There are many stories about water and the mysteries of life. One story tells of a man who saw a beautiful image of himself in the water, tried to touch it, fell in, and drowned. Water shows us things we cannot hold, just like life.

When I say I go to sea when I feel bad, I do not mean that I travel as a passenger. Passengers must pay, and they usually feel sick and unhappy. I also do not go as a captain or a cook. I do not want important responsibilities. It is enough work to take care of myself.

I go as a simple sailor. People tell me what to do. At first it feels strange, especially if you come from a respected family or worked as a teacher before. But in time, you get used to it.

If a captain asks me to clean the deck, I do it. It does not harm my pride. Everyone, in some way, must follow orders in life. We are all pushed a little by others, and that is normal.

Sailors are also paid for their work, which I like. Passengers must pay instead. It feels much better to be paid than to pay.

I enjoy the fresh air and movement on the ship. The wind is usually stronger at the front where sailors stay. The captain, standing at the back, thinks he gets the best air, but actually he breathes what comes after us. Life is often like that: simple people lead the way without others noticing.

But why did I want to join a whaling ship this time? I cannot fully explain it. Maybe it was fate, something planned long before I was born. Maybe the idea of ​​the great whale excited me. I love far places, strange seas, and the mysteries of nature. I am always curious about dangerous and unknown things.

So I welcomed the whaling voyage. It opened a door into a world of wonder. In my mind, I saw many whales, and in the middle of them, one great white shape, like a mountain of snow floating in the air.
