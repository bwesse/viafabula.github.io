I packed a couple of shirts into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and set off toward Cape Horn and the Pacific. Leaving Manhattan behind, I reached New Bedford on a cold December Saturday night, only to discover that the small packet for Nantucket had already sailed and that no other boat would leave until Monday.

Most young men headed into the harsh world of whaling stop in New Bedford before they ship out, but I had no intention of joining them. I was determined to sail only on a Nantucket vessel. Something about that island—its rough energy, its proud history—had a strong pull on me. And although New Bedford had surpassed Nantucket in the whaling trade, Nantucket was still the original source of it all: the place where the first American whale washed ashore, the home of the first native whalemen, the port where—so the story goes—the first small sloop went out armed with cobblestones to test how close a whale was before risking a harpoon.

With a night, a full day, and another night ahead before I could leave, I had to figure out where to eat and sleep. The night was bleak: dark, cold, and unfriendly. I knew no one in town. When I checked my pockets, I found only a few silver coins. Wherever you end up, Ishmael, I told myself as I stood in the empty street comparing one direction’s darkness to the other, remember to ask the price first, and don’t be too picky.

I walked on and passed the sign for “The Crossed Harpoons,” but the place looked too cheerful—and too expensive. A little farther on, the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn” glowed so warmly that they seemed to have melted the ice and snow at the doorstep. Everywhere else, the frost lay thick and solid. Every step hurt, since the soles of my boots were nearly gone. Again too lively, too costly, I thought, pausing to listen to the cheerful clinking of glasses. Keep moving, Ishmael; your patched boots don’t belong here. I kept going, drifting toward the waterfront, where the inns were cheaper, even if they weren’t the most welcoming.

Those streets were desolate—rows of darkness rather than houses—and only the occasional candlelight flickered like a wandering flame in a tomb. At that hour, on the last night of the week, the whole area felt abandoned. But soon I found a smoky glow coming from a low building with its door open. It looked like a place meant for anyone to walk in. I stepped inside and immediately stumbled over an ash-box, choking on the dust. If the earlier inns were “The Crossed Harpoons” and “The Sword-Fish,” then this must be “The Trap,” I thought. I brushed myself off, heard a loud voice beyond an inner door, pushed it open, and stepped in.

It felt like a dark parliament gathered in the underworld. Rows of faces turned toward me, and at the pulpit a preacher struck his book as he spoke of darkness, despair, and gnashing teeth. It was a Black church service. Poor entertainment at “The Trap,” I muttered, backing out.

I kept on until I saw a dim light near the docks and heard a weary creak overhead. A swinging sign showed a faint image of a tall spray of water and the words, “The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”

Coffin? Spouter? A grim combination. Still, Coffin is a common Nantucket name, and perhaps Peter came from there. The light was dim, the place quiet, the wooden building run-down and leaning. The sign creaked like a symbol of poverty itself. Perfect for cheap lodging, I thought—and maybe some decent pea coffee.

The building was odd: a gabled house with one side sagging, as if paralyzed. It stood on a windy corner where the gale called Euroclydon roared louder than it ever did around Paul’s storm-tossed ship. Yet from indoors, with warm feet by the fire, Euroclydon becomes almost comforting. An old author once wrote that the wind feels very different when seen from behind a frosted window than when felt through a window with no glass at all, with frost on both sides and Death as the only glazier. True enough, I thought. These eyes are windows; this body is the house. Too bad the builders didn’t seal the cracks. Too late now—the universe is finished.

Poor Lazarus, lying on the curb outside, teeth chattering, shaking in rags—he could stuff his ears with cloth and his mouth with a corn-cob, and still the wind would cut through him. Meanwhile Dives, wrapped in a rich red robe, calls the night beautiful and admires the stars and northern lights. Let others praise warm tropical climates; he’s happy to make his own summer with his own fire.

But what about Lazarus? Can he warm his freezing hands by holding them up to the aurora? Would he not rather be in Sumatra? Or lying along the blazing equator? Or even slipping into the fiery depths themselves if it meant escaping this cold?

That Lazarus should freeze outside Dives’s door is stranger than imagining an iceberg moored next to a tropical island. Yet Dives, too, lives in a palace of ice formed from frozen sighs and, as a temperance advocate, drinks only the lukewarm tears of orphans.

But enough of that. We’re heading out on a whaling voyage, and there will be more than enough talk of blubber later. For now, let’s shake the frost from our boots and see what kind of place this “Spouter” really is.
