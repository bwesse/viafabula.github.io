I packed a couple of shirts into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and set out for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Leaving old Manhattan behind, I made my way to New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in December. I was disappointed to learn that the small packet boat to Nantucket had already sailed, and that no other way to reach the island would be available until Monday.

Most young men heading into the hard world of whaling stop in New Bedford before they sail, but I had no intention of joining their ranks. I was set on sailing only on a Nantucket vessel. Everything about that old island had a rough, spirited charm that delighted me. And although New Bedford had risen in the whaling business while Nantucket had fallen behind, Nantucket was the original source of it all—the Tyre to this Carthage, the place where the first American whale washed ashore. From Nantucket, the Red-Men first paddled out after whales in canoes; from Nantucket, so they say, the first bold little sloop set out carrying imported cobblestones to hurl at whales, just to judge when they were close enough for a harpoon from the bowsprit.

With a night, a day, and another night ahead before I could take a ship for my chosen port, I had to decide where to eat and sleep. The night was gloomy, bitterly cold, and comfortless. I knew no one in town. When I checked my pockets, I found only a few silver coins. Wherever you go, Ishmael, I told myself as I stood in the middle of a bleak street, comparing the darkness to the north with the darkness to the south—wherever you choose to lodge tonight, make sure you ask the price and don’t be too fussy.

I walked slowly, passing the sign of “The Crossed Harpoons”—but the place looked too cheerful and too expensive. A little farther on, the red-lit windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn” glowed so warmly they seemed to have melted the snow and ice in front of the building; everywhere else the frost lay packed ten inches thick. Every step was painful, because the soles of my boots were worn nearly through. Too jolly and too costly, I thought, pausing to listen to the tinkling glasses inside. Move along, Ishmael, I said to myself; your ragged boots are blocking the doorway. So I went on, naturally drifting toward the waterfront, where the inns were surely cheaper if less pleasant.

Those streets were desolate—dark blocks rather than houses, and here and there a candle wandering like a light in a tomb. At that hour, on the last night of the week, the whole quarter seemed nearly abandoned. But soon I noticed a smoky light from a low, wide building with its door open. It seemed carelessly public, so I stepped in and immediately stumbled over an ash-box in the entry. Ha! I thought, choking on the flying dust, are these ashes from Gomorrah? If the earlier places were “The Crossed Harpoons” and “The Sword-Fish,” then this must be “The Trap.” Picking myself up, I heard a loud voice inside, pushed through another door, and looked in.

It felt like a Black Parliament in the depths of Tophet. A hundred faces turned toward me, and at the pulpit stood a dark figure pounding a book, preaching about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing to come. A Black church service. Ha, Ishmael, I muttered as I backed out—poor entertainment indeed at the sign of “The Trap.”

Moving on, I finally came to a dim light near the docks and heard a lonely creaking overhead. A sign swung above a doorway, painted with a tall misty jet of spray and the words “The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”

Coffin? Spouter? A grim pair of names together, I thought. But “Coffin” is common in Nantucket, and perhaps this Peter came from there. The light was dim, the place quiet enough, the old wooden building looking as if it had been dragged from the ruins of a fire. The sign creaked like poverty itself. This seems just right for cheap lodging, I thought—and maybe some decent pea coffee.

The place was strange—a gable-ended house, one side sagging like a paralytic limb. It stood at a bleak corner where the fierce wind Euroclydon howled louder than it ever did around Paul’s battered ship. Yet Euroclydon is a pleasant breeze to anyone indoors with feet warmed by the hearth. An old writer once said—“It makes a great difference whether you face Euroclydon through a window covered in frost on the outside, or through a window with no glass, the frost on both sides, and Death himself acting as glazier.” True enough, I thought. These eyes are windows; this body is the house. Pity they didn’t seal the cracks when they built it. But too late now—the universe is finished and the debris hauled away ages ago. Poor Lazarus there, using a curbstone for a pillow, shivering and rattling his teeth—he could stuff rags in his ears and a corn-cob in his mouth and still the wind would pierce him. Meanwhile old Dives, wrapped in red silk, calls the night fine and crisp, admiring Orion and the northern lights. Let others boast of tropical lands; he is content to make his own summer with his own fires.

But what of Lazarus? Can he warm his trembling hands at the northern lights? Would he not rather be in Sumatra? Would he not rather lie stretched along the equator itself—or even descend into the fiery pit—than endure this cold?

That Lazarus should lie freezing on the curb before Dives’s door is stranger than imagining an iceberg moored to a tropical island. Yet Dives, too, lives like a czar in a palace of ice made from frozen sighs and drinks only the lukewarm tears of orphans, being president of a temperance society.

But enough of this; we are bound for a whaling voyage, and there will be no shortage of blubber soon. Let us scrape the ice from our feet and see what sort of place this “Spouter” turns out to be.
