I put some shirts in my old bag and started my trip. I left Manhattan and came to New Bedford on a very cold Saturday night in December. I felt sad because the small boat to Nantucket was gone, and the next one would only go on Monday.

Many young men who want to hunt whales stay in New Bedford first, but I did not want that. I wanted a ship from Nantucket. The island felt strong and exciting to me. People there were the first to hunt whales.

I had to wait one night, one day, and one more night. I needed a place to eat and sleep. The night was very dark and very cold. I did not know anyone. I had only a little money. So I told myself: Ishmael, ask the price and do not expect much.

I walked and passed an inn called “The Crossed Harpoons,” but it looked too expensive. Then I saw the “Sword-Fish Inn.” It had warm red light, and the snow in front looked melted. But it was also too expensive for me. My boots were old and hurt my feet. So I kept walking to the docks, where cheaper places were.

The streets were very empty and very dark. I saw only a few small lights. Then I saw a little smoky light from a low house. The door was open. I went inside and tripped over a box. I heard a loud voice in another room. I opened a door and saw a church with Black people listening to a man talk about sadness and darkness. This was not the place for me, so I left.

I walked until I saw a small wooden house with a sign moving in the wind. The sign showed a tall spray of water and the words “The Spouter Inn — Peter Coffin.”

The names sounded strange, but the house looked old, simple, and quiet. It looked cheap, and maybe I could get some warm coffee.

The house leaned to one side. The wind was very strong. But inside, with warm feet near a fire, the wind would feel better. I thought about how cold it is outside and how hard it is for poor people in the street, while rich people inside a warm home think the night is nice.

But I stopped thinking about that. I would go on a whaling trip soon. Now I needed to brush the ice off my boots and see what this “Spouter Inn” was like.
