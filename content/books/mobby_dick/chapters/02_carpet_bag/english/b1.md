I put a couple of shirts into my old carpet-bag, carried it under my arm, and started my trip toward Cape Horn and the Pacific. After leaving Manhattan, I arrived in New Bedford on a cold Saturday night in December. I felt disappointed when I learned that the small boat to Nantucket had already left and that no other boat would go until Monday.

Most young men who want to become whalers stop in New Bedford before their voyage, but I did not plan to do that. I wanted to sail only on a Nantucket ship. Something about that island felt strong, rough, and exciting to me. And even though New Bedford had now become more important in whaling, Nantucket was where everything began—the place of the first American whale and the first native whalemen. There was even a story about the first small ship going out with cobblestones on board to throw at whales just to know when they were close enough for a harpoon.

Because I had to wait one night, one day, and another night before I could leave, I had to find a place to eat and sleep. The night was dark, freezing, and unfriendly. I knew no one in the town. When I checked my pockets, I found only a few silver coins. So I told myself: Ishmael, wherever you go tonight, make sure to ask the price and don’t be too picky.

I walked through the streets and passed an inn called “The Crossed Harpoons,” but it looked too expensive and too cheerful. A little farther on, the “Sword-Fish Inn” had bright red windows that gave off so much warm light that the snow in front seemed to have melted. Everywhere else, the frost lay thick, and my worn-out boots made walking painful. Too lively and too costly, I thought as I heard glasses clinking inside. Move on, Ishmael. So I kept walking toward the docks, where the cheapest inns were usually found.

Those streets were empty and gloomy, with only a few small lights here and there. It felt almost like walking through a deserted town. But soon I saw a smoky light coming from a low building with an open door. It looked like a place for the public, so I went in—and immediately stumbled over a box of ashes. Coughing, I wondered if I had walked into some kind of trap. I heard a loud voice in the next room, opened another door, and saw a church full of Black people listening to a preacher who spoke about darkness and suffering. This was certainly not the place I was looking for, so I backed out quickly.

I continued on until I reached a dim light near the docks. Above a small wooden building, a sign swung in the wind. It showed a tall spray of water and the words “The Spouter Inn — Peter Coffin.”

Coffin? Spouter? It sounded strange together. But “Coffin” is a common name in Nantucket, so I did not worry too much. The place looked old, poor, and quiet. The sign creaked sadly in the wind. It seemed like just the right place for cheap lodging—and maybe some good pea coffee.

The building leaned to one side, as if it were very old and tired. It stood on a windy corner where the strong wind called Euroclydon howled loudly. Still, that same wind feels much nicer when you are inside with warm feet near the fire. An old writer once said that a storm looks very different when seen through a warm, safe window compared to facing it directly without protection. I agreed with that thought. This body of mine is like a house too, I said to myself. Too bad the builders did not close the cracks better.

Outside, a poor man lay shaking on the cold stone, unable to escape the wind no matter what he did. Meanwhile, a rich man inside a warm home might enjoy the stars and think the night was beautiful. The rich can make their own “summer” with a fire, while the poor freeze outside.

But enough of that. We are going on a whaling voyage soon, and there will be plenty of trouble and adventure waiting for us. For now, let’s brush the ice from our boots and see what kind of place this “Spouter Inn” really is.
