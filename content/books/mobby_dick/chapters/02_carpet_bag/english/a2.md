I put a couple of shirts into my old bag, held it under my arm, and began my trip toward Cape Horn and the Pacific. After leaving Manhattan, I arrived in New Bedford on a cold Saturday night in December. I was disappointed when I found out that the small boat to Nantucket had already left, and that no other boat would go until Monday.

Most young men who want to become whalers stay in New Bedford before they leave, but I did not want to do that. I wanted to sail only on a ship from Nantucket. That island felt exciting and strong to me. Even though New Bedford was now more important in whaling, Nantucket was the place where it all started—the first American whale, the first people who hunted whales. There was even a story about a small ship that threw stones at whales to see when they were close enough for a harpoon.

Since I had to wait one night, one day, and another night before I could leave, I needed to find a place to eat and sleep. The night was dark, very cold, and not friendly. I knew no one in the town. When I checked my pockets, I had only a few coins. So I told myself, Ishmael, wherever you go tonight, ask the price first and don’t expect too much.

I walked through the streets and passed an inn called “The Crossed Harpoons,” but it looked too expensive and too happy. A little farther on, I saw the “Sword-Fish Inn,” with bright red windows and warm light that seemed to melt the snow in front. Everywhere else, the frost was thick and hard. My old boots were almost broken, and walking hurt. Too expensive, too busy, I thought as I heard the glasses inside. Keep going, Ishmael. So I walked toward the docks, where the cheaper inns usually were.

The streets became very empty and dark. Only a few small lights were visible. It felt like a lonely place. But then I saw a smoky light coming from a low building. The door was open, so I went inside. Right away I tripped over a box of ashes and coughed. Maybe this is a bad place, I thought. I heard a loud voice behind another door, opened it, and found a church full of Black people listening to a preacher talking about darkness and suffering. This was not the place for me, so I left quietly.

I continued walking until I saw a dim light near the water. A sign was moving in the wind above a small wooden house. It showed a tall spray of water and the words “The Spouter Inn — Peter Coffin.”

Coffin? Spouter? Strange names together, I thought. But “Coffin” is a common name in Nantucket, so I did not worry. The place looked old, poor, and quiet. The sign made a sad sound in the wind. This might be a cheap place to stay—and maybe I could get some good hot coffee.

The building leaned to one side and looked very old. It stood in a windy corner where the strong wind called Euroclydon blew loudly. Still, that wind feels better when you are inside with warm feet by a fire. An old writer once said that a storm looks very different when you see it from a warm window than when you feel it directly outside. I agreed. My body feels like a house too, I thought. Too bad the builders didn’t close the holes better.

Outside, a poor man lay shaking from the cold, unable to escape the wind. Meanwhile, a rich man inside a warm house might enjoy the stars and think the night was beautiful. The rich can make their own “summer” with a fire, while the poor freeze outside.

But enough thinking about that. I was going on a whaling trip soon, and there would be many hard things ahead. For now, I needed to brush the ice from my boots and see what kind of place this “Spouter Inn” was.
