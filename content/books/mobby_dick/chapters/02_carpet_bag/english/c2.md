I packed a couple of shirts into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and set out for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Leaving Manhattan behind, I reached New Bedford on a raw December Saturday night, only to discover that the small packet boat to Nantucket had already sailed and wouldn’t depart again until Monday.

Most novices heading into the brutal world of whaling pause in New Bedford before shipping out, but I had no intention of joining them. My mind was fixed: I would sail only on a Nantucket vessel. Everything about that island carried a rugged, salt-roughened vitality that captivated me. And though New Bedford had risen to dominate the whaling trade while Nantucket waned, Nantucket remained the origin of it all—the Tyre to this Carthage, the place where the first American whale washed ashore. From there, the native whalemen first chased leviathans in their canoes; from there, according to old tales, the first daring little sloop ventured out, loaded with cobblestones to hurl at whales just to judge when the harpooner could safely strike.

With a night, a full day, and another night ahead of me before I could sail, I had to solve the immediate problem of where to eat and sleep. The night was bleak: dark, raw, and cuttingly cold. I knew no one. A quick search of my pockets turned up only a few silver coins. So, wherever you end up, Ishmael, I told myself as I stood alone in the empty street, comparing the northern gloom with the southern darkness—ask the price first, and don’t be too fastidious.

I wandered on, passing the sign of “The Crossed Harpoons”—too lively, too costly. A little farther along, the red-lit windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn” glowed so intensely they seemed to have melted the very ice before the door; everywhere else the frost lay thick and unbroken. Each step was painful, the soles of my boots worn almost to nothing. Again too cheerful and too expensive, I thought, listening to the bright clink of glasses inside. Move along, Ishmael; your patched boots aren’t welcome here. And so I kept on, letting instinct guide me toward the waterfront, where the inns were cheaper, if gloomier.

The streets grew darker—solid walls of shadow rather than houses—and the occasional candle flickering behind a window looked like a light drifting through a tomb. At that late hour on the last night of the week, the entire quarter seemed deserted. But soon I spotted a hazy, smoky glow leaking from a broad, low building whose open door suggested a general welcome. I stepped in, immediately tripped over an ash-box, coughed through a cloud of dust, and muttered to myself about Gomorrah. If the earlier inns were “The Crossed Harpoons” and “The Sword-Fish,” surely this one must be “The Trap.” Brushing myself off, I heard a booming voice ahead, pushed through an inner door, and looked inside.

It felt like a somber parliament gathered in the pit of Tophet—row upon row of dark faces turned toward me, and at the pulpit a preacher drove his hand against a book as he spoke of darkness, wailing, and gnashing teeth. A Black church service. Poor entertainment indeed at the sign of “The Trap,” I thought as I retreated.

I continued on until I saw a dim, wavering light near the docks and heard a lonely creaking overhead. A sign swung above a doorway, just visible enough to make out a tall misty jet of spray and the words, “The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”

Coffin? Spouter? An ominous pairing, I thought. Still, “Coffin” is a common Nantucket name, and perhaps Peter was from there. The light was faint, the place quiet, the wooden building weather-beaten and sagging as if salvaged from the ruins of a fire. The sign creaked with the melancholy sound of poverty. Perfect, I thought—cheap lodgings and, if fortune smiled, decent pea coffee.

The house itself was odd, its gable end leaning as though one side had suffered a stroke. It stood on a windswept corner where the gale known as Euroclydon howled more fiercely than it ever had around Paul’s storm-tossed ship. Yet Euroclydon is a pleasant breeze to anyone indoors with warm feet by the hearth. An old author—whose book I happen to own in the only surviving copy—once wrote, “It maketh a great difference whether thou lookest upon Euroclydon from behind a frost-covered window, or whether thou feelest it through a window without glass, where frost grows on both sides, and where Death himself is the glazier.” True enough. These eyes are windows; this body is the house. Pity the builders didn’t stop up the cracks. Too late now—the universe is finished and the scraps were cleared away ages ago.

Poor Lazarus there on the curb, shaking in his rags, using the frozen stone as a pillow—he could plug his ears with cloth and his mouth with a corn-cob, yet Euroclydon would still find him. Meanwhile old Dives, wrapped in a red silken robe, declares the night splendid, admiring Orion and the northern lights. Let others dream of tropical paradises; he is content to make his own summer with his own fire.

But what of Lazarus? Can he warm his frozen hands on the northern lights? Would he not rather be in Sumatra? Would he not rather lie along the blazing equator—or even descend into the fiery depths themselves—than endure this cold?

That Lazarus should lie freezing on Dives’s doorstep is stranger than imagining an iceberg chained to a tropical shore. Yet Dives, too, dwells like a czar in a palace fashioned from frozen sighs, drinking only the lukewarm tears of orphans in the name of temperance.

But enough of this. We’re bound for a whaling voyage, and there’ll be more than enough blubber ahead. Let’s scrape the frost from our boots and see what sort of place this “Spouter” really is.
