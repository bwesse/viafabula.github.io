I put a couple of shirts into my old carpet-bag, carried it under my arm, and started out toward Cape Horn and the Pacific. After leaving Manhattan, I arrived in New Bedford on a cold December Saturday night. I was disappointed to learn that the small boat to Nantucket had already left, and that no other chance to get there would come until Monday.

Most young men who plan to go whaling stay in New Bedford before they leave, but I had no plan of doing that. I wanted to sail only on a Nantucket ship. Everything about that island seemed wild and exciting to me. And even though New Bedford had become more important in whaling, Nantucket was where it all began—the place where the first American whale washed ashore, the home of the first native whalemen, and the port where, according to stories, the first small boat went out carrying cobblestones to throw at whales to see when they were close enough to harpoon.

Since I had a night, a day, and another night before I could board a ship, I needed to find somewhere to eat and sleep. The night was dark, freezing, and unfriendly. I knew no one. When I checked my pockets, I found only a little silver. Wherever you stay, Ishmael, I told myself, make sure you ask the price first and don’t be too picky.

I walked through the streets and passed an inn called “The Crossed Harpoons,” but it looked too cheerful and too expensive. A bit farther on, the red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn” shone so warmly that the snow in front seemed to have melted. Everywhere else the frost was thick and hard. My boots were worn thin, and every step hurt. Too expensive and too lively for me, I thought as I listened to the sound of glasses inside. Move on, Ishmael, I told myself. And so I headed toward the docks, where the cheapest inns were likely to be.

The streets became darker and emptier, with only a few small lights here and there. It felt almost like walking through a deserted town. But soon I came to a building giving off a smoky light, and the door was open. It looked like a place meant for anyone to enter. I stepped inside and immediately stumbled over a box of ashes, coughing as the dust flew up. Maybe this place really *is* a trap, I thought. I heard a loud voice in the next room, pushed open another door, and looked inside.

The room felt like some kind of dark gathering. Many faces turned to look at me, and at the front a preacher was speaking loudly about darkness and suffering. It was a Black church service. Not the kind of place I meant to walk into, so I quietly backed out.

I continued toward the water until I saw a dim light and heard a sign creaking in the wind. Hanging above a small wooden building was a painted image of a tall spray of water and the words “The Spouter Inn — Peter Coffin.”

Coffin? Spouter? That sounded a bit strange together. But “Coffin” is a common name in Nantucket, I reminded myself. The light inside was dim, the building looked old and worn, and the swinging sign creaked like it belonged to a poor place. That made me think it might be cheap enough for my small budget—and maybe the coffee would be good too.

The building was odd, leaning to one side as if it were tired. It stood on a cold, windy corner where the strong wind called Euroclydon howled loudly. Still, that same wind can feel pleasant if you’re inside with warm feet by the fire. An old writer once said that a storm looks very different when you see it from behind a warm window compared to when you face it directly with no protection. That thought made sense to me. This body of mine is like a house, I thought. Too bad the builders didn’t seal the cracks better.

Outside, a poor man shivered on the street with nothing to protect him from the cold. No matter what he stuffed in his ears or mouth, the icy wind would still reach him. Meanwhile, a rich man inside a warm home might admire the stars and pretend the night was beautiful. He could make his own “summer” with a fire, while Lazarus outside shook in the freezing darkness.

But enough of that. We’re going whaling soon, and there will be plenty of talk about hard things later. For now, let’s brush the ice from our boots and take a look at this “Spouter Inn.”
