I put a few shirts into my old bag, carried it under my arm, and started my trip toward Cape Horn and the Pacific. After leaving Manhattan, I arrived in New Bedford on a cold Saturday night in December. I was sad to learn that the small boat to Nantucket had already gone, and that no other boat would leave until Monday.

Most young men who want to work in whaling stay in New Bedford first, but I did not want that. I wanted to sail only on a Nantucket ship. The island felt strong and exciting to me. Even if New Bedford was now more important, Nantucket was where whaling first began. People there were the first to hunt whales, and there were even stories of a small boat throwing stones at whales to see when they were close enough for a harpoon.

Because I had to wait one night, then one day, and then another night, I needed to find a place to eat and sleep. The night was very dark, very cold, and not friendly. I knew no one. When I looked in my pockets, I had only a few coins. So I told myself: Ishmael, ask the price first and do not expect too much.

I walked through the streets and passed an inn called “The Crossed Harpoons,” but it looked too expensive. A little farther, the “Sword-Fish Inn” had bright red windows with warm light that seemed to melt the snow. Everywhere else the frost was thick. My old boots were almost broken, and walking hurt. Too expensive, I thought. So I kept walking toward the docks, where cheaper inns usually were.

The streets were very empty and very dark. Only a few small lights showed. It felt lonely. Then I saw a smoky light from a low building. The door was open, so I walked inside and quickly tripped over a box of ashes. I coughed and thought maybe this place was not good. I heard a loud voice in the next room, opened a door, and saw a church full of Black people listening to a preacher talking about darkness and sadness. This was not my place, so I left.

I walked on until I saw a dim light near the water. A sign moved in the wind above a small wooden building. It showed a tall spray of water and said “The Spouter Inn — Peter Coffin.”

Coffin? Spouter? The names sounded strange, but “Coffin” is common in Nantucket, so I did not worry. The place looked old, poor, and quiet. The sign made a sad sound in the wind. It seemed like it could be cheap—and maybe have some warm coffee.

The building leaned to one side and looked very old. It stood on a windy corner where a strong wind called Euroclydon blew loudly. But that wind feels much better when you are inside with warm feet near a fire. An old writer once said that a storm looks very different when you see it through a warm window than when you feel it outside. I agreed with that. My body felt like a house too, I thought. Too bad it was not built tighter.

Outside, a poor man lay shaking in the cold air. No matter what he did, he could not escape the wind. But a rich man inside a warm home might enjoy the stars and think the night was beautiful. The rich can make their own “summer” with a fire, while the poor freeze.

But enough about that. I was going on a whaling trip soon. For now, I needed to brush the ice from my boots and see what kind of place this “Spouter Inn” was.
