Now the next day, the big bad wolf came along.
He was very hungry and had been searching for food all morning.
When he saw the first little pig's house of straw, he licked his chops and said:
"Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"
"No, no, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!" said the little pig.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" said the wolf.
