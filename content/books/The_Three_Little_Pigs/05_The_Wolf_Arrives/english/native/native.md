It wasn't long before a big bad wolf came prowling through the forest.
He was hungry, and when he spotted the first pig's straw house, his eyes lit up.
"Little pig, little pig, let me come in!" he called out.
The pig, terrified, shouted back, "No, no! Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!"
The wolf snarled with anger.
