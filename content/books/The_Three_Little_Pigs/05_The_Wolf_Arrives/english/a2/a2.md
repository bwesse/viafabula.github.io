One day, a big bad wolf came through the forest.
He was hungry and looking for food.
He saw the first pig's straw house.
"Little pig, little pig, let me in!" called the wolf.
"Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!" replied the pig.
The wolf became very angry.
This moment would be remembered by all the pigs.
