The next day, the three little pigs set off to seek their fortunes. As they walked along the lane they met a man carrying a bundle of straw.
"Please, Man," said the first little pig, "will you let me have that straw to build my house?"
"Why, certainly," said the kind man, and he gave the straw to the first little pig.
So the first little pig built his house out of straw. He worked very quickly because he wanted to play, and soon his house was finished.
