The three brothers walked down the forest path, talking about their plans.
The first pig was cheerful and carefree. "I'm going to build my house quickly so I can have fun!" he announced.
The second pig nodded. "That sounds good. I don't want to work too hard either."
The third pig looked worried. "But Mother said to build strong houses. The wolf is dangerous."
The first pig laughed. "Don't worry so much! We'll be fine."
Soon, they came to a clearing where they would part ways to build their houses.
