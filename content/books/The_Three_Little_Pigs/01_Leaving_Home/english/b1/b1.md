As the three brothers made their way down the winding forest path, they discussed their plans for the future.
The first pig, who was known for his lighthearted nature, bounced along cheerfully. "I plan to build my house as quickly as possible," he declared. "The sooner I finish, the more time I'll have for games and leisure!"
The second pig agreed with enthusiasm. "That's a sensible approach. Why spend all our time working when we could be enjoying ourselves?"
The third pig, however, walked more slowly, his face showing concern. "Brothers, don't you remember Mother's warning about the wolf? She told us to build carefully and make our houses strong. We shouldn't take shortcuts."
The first pig dismissed his worry with a wave of his hoof. "You worry too much, brother. Everything will work out fine. We're clever pigs!"
Before long, they reached a spacious clearing where three paths diverged. This would be the place where they would separate, each to find his own plot of land and begin construction. They embraced one another, promised to visit soon, and then each headed down a different path.
