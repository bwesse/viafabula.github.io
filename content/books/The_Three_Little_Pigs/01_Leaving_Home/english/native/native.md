The three pigs walked down the road together.
They were excited but also nervous about building their own homes.
"I'm going to build mine fast so I can play!" said the first pig.
The third pig shook his head. "Mother warned us about the wolf. We need to build strong houses."
But the first pig just laughed. Soon they reached a clearing where they would go their separate ways.
