The wolf tried and tried but could not blow down the brick house. Finally, tired and defeated, he gave up and ran away into the forest. The three pigs were safe at last. "You were right, brother," said the first pig. "Hard work and good planning are important." From that day on, all three pigs lived together in the strong brick house. And they never saw the big bad wolf again.

This experience demonstrated the fundamental importance of thorough preparation and the willingness to invest effort in achieving long-term security rather than pursuing short-term convenience.
