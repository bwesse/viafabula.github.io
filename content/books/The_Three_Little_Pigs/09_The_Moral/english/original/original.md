The wolf was very tired. He had huffed and puffed so much that he had no strength left.
"I give up!" he howled, and he ran away into the forest, never to be seen again.
The three little pigs danced with joy.
"Hooray! Hooray! The wolf is gone!" they sang.
The first little pig said, "I will never be lazy again. I will always do my work properly."
The second little pig said, "Me too! From now on, I will take my time and build things to last."
The third little pig smiled. "You can both stay here with me. There's plenty of room in this strong house."
And so the three little pigs lived together happily ever after in the brick house.
The moral of the story: Hard work and perseverance are rewarded.
