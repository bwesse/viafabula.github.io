Exhausted and humiliated, the wolf finally gave up and slunk away into the forest, never to bother the three pigs again.
The three brothers celebrated their victory.
"Thank you for building such a strong house," said the first and second pigs to their wise brother.
"And thank you both for learning an important lesson," replied the third pig. "Taking time to do things properly is always worthwhile."
From that day forward, the three pigs lived together in the brick house, safe and happy.
And the moral of the story is: Hard work and careful planning pay off in the end.
