The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks.
He gathered sticks and twigs from the forest and bundled them together to make walls.
"This is better than straw," he said. "But I don't want to work too hard."
In just one day, his stick house was finished and he went off to play.
