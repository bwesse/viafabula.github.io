Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother in a small cottage.
As they grew older, their mother told them it was time to leave home and build their own houses.
"The world can be dangerous," she warned them. "Build your houses strong and be careful of the big bad wolf."
The three brothers hugged their mother goodbye and set off on their journey, each planning to build his own home.
