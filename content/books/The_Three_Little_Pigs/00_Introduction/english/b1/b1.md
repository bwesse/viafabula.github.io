Once upon a time, in a cozy cottage at the edge of the forest, there lived a mother pig and her three sons.
The three little pigs had grown into strong young adults, and their mother knew it was time for them to make their own way in the world.
One morning, she gathered them together and said, "My dear sons, you are ready to leave home now. Each of you must build your own house. But remember my words: work hard and build wisely, for there is a dangerous wolf in the forest who preys on the foolish and lazy."
The three brothers, though nervous about leaving their comfortable home, promised to heed their mother's advice. After tearful farewells, they set off together down the forest path, each with his own ideas about what kind of house to build.
