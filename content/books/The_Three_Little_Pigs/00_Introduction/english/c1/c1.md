In a time long past, within a modest yet comfortable dwelling situated at the periphery of an ancient forest, a devoted mother pig had raised her three sons with unwavering dedication and affection.
Through the passage of seasons and the inevitable march of time, these young pigs had developed into capable individuals, each with his own distinct personality and approach to life. Their mother, possessed of wisdom earned through years of experience, understood that the moment had arrived for them to depart from the security of their childhood home and forge their own paths in the world.
On a particular autumn morning, when the air carried the scent of falling leaves and approaching winter, she summoned her sons and addressed them with a voice that trembled slightly with maternal emotion. "My dearest children, watching you grow has been the greatest joy of my life. You are now mature enough to establish your own households and pursue your own destinies. However, I must caution you: the world beyond our threshold is not always kind to the innocent or the complacent. You must be vigilant, particularly regarding the notorious wolf who stalks these woods. He is a creature of considerable cunning and malevolence, one who exploits the weaknesses of those who fail to prepare adequately or who allow themselves to be deceived by shortcuts and false promises."
The three brothers, though filled with a complex mixture of excitement and trepidation about abandoning the familiar comforts of their upbringing, solemnly vowed to carry their mother's warnings in their hearts. Following an emotionally charged farewell replete with embraces and assurances of future reunions, they set forth on their respective journeys, each brother contemplating the nature of the dwelling he would construct and the principles that would guide his construction choices.
