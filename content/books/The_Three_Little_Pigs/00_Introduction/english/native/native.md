Long ago, a mother pig lived with her three sons in a small cottage at the edge of the forest.
As her sons grew older, she knew the time had come for them to leave home and start their own lives.
One morning, she called them together and said, "You're grown now, and it's time to build your own houses. But be careful—there's a big bad wolf in these woods who will try to catch you if you're not smart about it."
The three pigs, both excited and nervous, promised to remember her advice. After saying goodbye, they headed out into the world, each thinking about what kind of house he would build.
