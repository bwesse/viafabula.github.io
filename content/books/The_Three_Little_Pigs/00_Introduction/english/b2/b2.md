Once upon a time, in a charming cottage nestled at the forest's edge, a mother pig raised her three sons with love and care.
As the seasons passed and the young pigs matured, she recognized that the time had come for them to venture out and establish their independence.
One crisp autumn morning, she called her sons to her side and spoke with a mixture of pride and concern. "My beloved children, you have grown into fine young pigs, and I am proud of the individuals you have become. However, you must now leave the safety of our home and build your own dwellings. The world beyond our door holds both opportunity and danger. Above all, beware of the cunning wolf who roams these woods. He is clever and ruthless, preying upon those who are careless or unprepared."
The three brothers, despite their apprehension about leaving the only home they had ever known, assured their mother they would remember her counsel. After emotional goodbyes filled with hugs and promises to visit, they embarked on their journey into the wider world, each contemplating what sort of home would best suit his needs and temperament.
