The first pig found some straw in a nearby field.
"This will be perfect," he thought. "I can build my house quickly and have lots of time to play."
He worked fast, stacking the straw into walls and a roof. In just a few hours, his straw house was complete.
"Done already!" he said proudly. "Now I can have fun."
And off he went to play, not worrying about how weak his house was.
