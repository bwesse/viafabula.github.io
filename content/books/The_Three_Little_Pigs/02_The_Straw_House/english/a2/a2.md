The first pig soon discovered a large pile of straw at the edge of a meadow.
"This is exactly what I need," he thought cheerfully. "Building with straw will be quick and easy."
Without wasting time, he gathered armfuls of straw and began stacking them to form walls.
By afternoon, he had constructed a simple house with a straw roof and straw walls.
"That was easy!" he exclaimed. "Now I have plenty of time for fun!"
He immediately went outside to play in the sunshine.
