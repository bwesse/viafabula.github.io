The first pig's explorations led him swiftly to a verdant meadow where a substantial quantity of harvested straw lay awaiting collection.
"What remarkable good fortune," he mused contentedly. "This material will facilitate the rapid construction of my domicile, leaving ample opportunity for leisure pursuits."
He negotiated with the landowner, who graciously permitted him to utilize whatever quantity of straw he required. Wasting no time on elaborate planning, the pig commenced his building project with enthusiasm if not particular care.
Employing rudimentary construction methods, he assembled walls by layering and binding straw stalks together. For the roof, he simply piled additional straw atop the structure, achieving a basic covering that would ostensibly provide protection from rain.
The entire endeavor consumed merely several hours of labor. By late afternoon, he had completed his residence—a humble dwelling that, while far from impressive in its craftsmanship, technically satisfied the requirement of providing shelter.
"There we are," he announced to himself with evident satisfaction. "My brothers are probably still deliberating over their building plans while I'm already finished. Mother's concerns about the wolf seem rather overblown. I'm quite safe here, and now I have the entire evening free for amusement."
He immediately set off to frolic in the meadow, his construction duties concluded to his complete satisfaction, however superficial his effort had been.
