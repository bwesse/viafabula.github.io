The first pig's journey didn't take him far before he came across an abundant supply of golden straw in a farmer's field.
"Fortune smiles upon me," he declared with satisfaction. "This straw will make a perfectly adequate dwelling, and I'll finish construction in no time at all."
He approached the farmer and asked permission to take some straw. The kind farmer agreed, and the pig set to work immediately.
Using simple techniques he had observed as a child, he wove the straw into walls and fashioned a roof. The entire construction process took only a single afternoon.
By evening, he stood back to admire his handiwork. The house was modest—little more than a hut, really—but it provided shelter from the elements.
"Well, that's done," he said cheerfully. "Mother worries too much. This house will serve me perfectly fine. Now, where shall I go to find some entertainment?"
With that, he trotted off to explore the nearby forest, leaving his new straw house behind.
