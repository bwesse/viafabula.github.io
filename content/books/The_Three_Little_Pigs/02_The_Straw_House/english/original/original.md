The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw.
He found a nice spot near the meadow and started piling up straw to make walls. He worked very quickly because he wanted to go play.
When the house was finished, it looked very flimsy. The walls swayed in the breeze. But the first little pig didn't care.
"That's good enough," he said. "Now I can dance and play all day!"
And that's exactly what he did.
