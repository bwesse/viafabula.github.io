The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks.
He found a bricklayer who taught him how to mix mortar and lay bricks properly.
Day after day, he labored, carefully placing each brick.
It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.
"Now I am safe," said the third pig with satisfaction.
