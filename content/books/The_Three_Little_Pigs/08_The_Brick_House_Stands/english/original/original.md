The third little pig let his brothers in and quickly locked the door.
The wolf soon arrived, panting and furious.
"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!" he howled.
"No, no! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!" shouted all three pigs together.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" roared the wolf.
So the wolf huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. He huffed and huffed and puffed and puffed.
But no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow down the brick house.
The house was too strong and well-built.
