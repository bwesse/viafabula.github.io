The third pig opened the door and pulled his brothers to safety.
Moments later, the wolf arrived, angrier than ever.
"Little pigs, let me in, or I'll blow this house down too!" he threatened.
"Do your worst!" called out the third pig bravely. "This house is built to last!"
The wolf huffed and puffed with all his strength, but the brick walls didn't even tremble.
He huffed and puffed again and again until he was exhausted, but the house stood strong.
