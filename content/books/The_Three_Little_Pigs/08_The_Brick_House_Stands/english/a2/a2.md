The third pig quickly let his brothers inside the brick house.
Soon the wolf arrived.
"Little pigs, let me come in!" he demanded.
"No! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!" they all shouted.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" roared the wolf.
He huffed and puffed with all his might, but the brick house stood firm.
The wolf could not blow it down!
This moment would be remembered by all the pigs.
