The wolf soon arrived at the stick house.
"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!" he called.
"No, no! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!" the two pigs replied.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" roared the wolf.
He huffed and puffed with all his strength, and down came the stick house.
The two pigs ran away quickly toward their brother's brick house.
