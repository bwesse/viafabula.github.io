The wolf wasted no time chasing the first pig to the stick house.
"Little pigs, little pigs, let me in!" he demanded.
"Never! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!" the two brothers shouted together.
Enraged, the wolf huffed and puffed with even more force.
The stick house shook, creaked, and then collapsed in a pile of broken sticks.
The two pigs fled in terror, racing toward their wise brother's brick house.
