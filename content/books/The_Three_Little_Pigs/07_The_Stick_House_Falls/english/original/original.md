The wolf followed them to the second little pig's house.
"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!" howled the wolf.
"No, no! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!" cried the two little pigs.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" shouted the angry wolf.
So the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down.
The two little pigs ran as fast as they could to their brother's brick house.
"Brother! Let us in! The wolf is coming!" they squealed.
