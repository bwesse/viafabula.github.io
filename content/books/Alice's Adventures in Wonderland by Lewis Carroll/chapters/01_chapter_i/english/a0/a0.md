Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice sits with her sister. She is bored. Her sister reads a book. The book has no pictures. Alice does not like it.

Alice is hot and sleepy. Then she sees a white rabbit. The rabbit has pink eyes. The rabbit runs past Alice.

The rabbit talks! It says, "Oh dear! I am late!" Alice is surprised. The rabbit has a watch. It takes the watch from its pocket. Then it runs away.

Alice runs after the rabbit. The rabbit goes down a big hole. Alice goes down the hole too.

Alice falls down, down, down. She falls for a long time. The hole is very deep. Alice sees cupboards and books on the walls. She takes a jar. The jar says "ORANGE MARMALADE." But the jar is empty. Alice puts it back.

Alice thinks, "I am falling far! Maybe I will fall to the other side of Earth!"

Finally, Alice stops falling. She lands on some leaves and sticks. She is not hurt.

Alice stands up. She sees a long hall. The rabbit is there! It runs away fast. Alice runs after it. But the rabbit is gone.

Alice is in a hall with many doors. All the doors are locked. Alice tries every door. She is sad. How can she get out?

Alice finds a small table. The table is made of glass. On the table is a little gold key. Alice tries the key on all the doors. The key is too small.

Then Alice finds a small door behind a curtain. The little key fits! Alice opens the door. She looks through it. She sees a beautiful garden. The garden has flowers and fountains. Alice wants to go there!

But Alice is too big. Her head cannot go through the door. Alice is sad. She wants to be smaller.

Alice goes back to the table. She finds a bottle. The bottle says "DRINK ME." Alice is careful. She checks if it says "poison." It does not.

Alice drinks from the bottle. It tastes good. It tastes like cherries, custard, pineapple, turkey, toffee, and toast!

Alice feels strange. She is getting smaller! Now she is only ten inches tall. She is the right size for the door!

But oh no! Alice forgot the key. The key is on the table. Alice is too small now. She cannot reach the table. She tries to climb up but she cannot. Alice sits down and cries.

Alice talks to herself. She says, "Stop crying! Be brave!" 

Alice finds a small box under the table. In the box is a small cake. The cake says "EAT ME." Alice thinks, "If I eat this, I will grow big or small. Either way, I can get into the garden!"

Alice eats the cake. She waits to see what happens.
