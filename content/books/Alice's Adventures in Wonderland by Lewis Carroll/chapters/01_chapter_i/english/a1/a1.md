Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice was sitting by the river with her sister. She was getting very tired and bored. Her sister was reading a book, but it had no pictures in it. "What is the use of a book without pictures?" thought Alice.

It was a hot day. Alice felt sleepy. She thought about making a flower chain, but she felt too lazy to get up.

Suddenly, a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran past her. There was nothing too strange about that. But then the Rabbit said to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!" Alice thought this was very curious. Then the Rabbit took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket, looked at it, and hurried on.

Alice jumped to her feet. She had never seen a rabbit with a pocket or a watch before! She was very curious, so she ran after it. She was just in time to see the Rabbit pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

Alice went down the hole after the Rabbit. She did not think about how she would get out again.

The hole went straight for a while, then suddenly went down very steeply. Alice found herself falling down what seemed like a very deep well.

Alice fell down, down, down. Would she ever stop falling? She had plenty of time to look around as she fell. The walls of the well had cupboards and bookshelves. She saw maps and pictures hanging on pegs. She took a jar from one shelf as she passed. It said "ORANGE MARMALADE" on it, but it was empty. She did not want to drop it in case it hit someone below, so she put it in one of the cupboards.

"I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth," Alice thought. She had learned about this in school. "That would be four thousand miles down, I think." Alice also thought about latitude and longitude, though she did not really know what those words meant. She just thought they were nice, important words to say.

Alice began to think she might fall right through the earth and come out on the other side, where people walk with their heads upside down!

Down, down, down. Alice started talking to herself. "Dinah will miss me tonight!" (Dinah was her cat.) "I hope they remember her milk at tea-time. Dear Dinah! I wish you were down here with me!" Alice began to get sleepy. She started saying, "Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?" She couldn't remember which question she was asking.

Suddenly, thump! Alice landed on a heap of sticks and dry leaves. The fall was over, and she was not hurt at all!

Alice jumped up quickly. She looked around. It was dark above her. In front of her was another long passage. The White Rabbit was there! Alice ran after it like the wind. She heard it say, "Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!" Then the Rabbit turned a corner and was gone.

Alice found herself in a long, low hall. There were lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all around the hall, but they were all locked. Alice tried every door. She walked down the middle of the hall, wondering how she would ever get out.

Then she found a little table with three legs. It was made of solid glass. On it was a tiny golden key. Alice thought it might open one of the doors, but the key was too small for all of them.

Then Alice noticed a low curtain she had not seen before. Behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, and it fitted!

Alice opened the door. It led to a small passage. At the end, she could see the loveliest garden with bright flowers and cool fountains. She wanted so much to get out of the dark hall and walk in that garden! But she could not even get her head through the doorway. "Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!" thought Alice.

Alice went back to the table, hoping to find another key or maybe a book of rules for making people smaller. This time she found a little bottle on it. Around the neck of the bottle was a label that said "DRINK ME" in large letters.

Alice was a wise little girl. She knew she should be careful. She checked the bottle to see if it said "poison" anywhere. It did not say poison, so she tasted it. It was very nice! It tasted like cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot toast all mixed together. She soon finished drinking it.

"What a curious feeling!" said Alice. "I must be shutting up like a telescope!"

And she was! She was now only ten inches high. She was happy because she was now the right size to go through the little door into the lovely garden. But when she got to the door, she found that she had forgotten the little golden key! When she went back to get it, she found she could not reach it. She could see it clearly through the glass table, but she was too small to climb up the table leg. She tried and tried, but finally she gave up. The poor little thing sat down and cried.

"Come, there's no use in crying!" Alice said to herself quite sharply. "Stop this minute!" She usually gave herself very good advice, though she did not often follow it.

Soon Alice noticed a little glass box under the table. She opened it and found a very small cake inside. The words "EAT ME" were beautifully written on it in currants.

"Well, I'll eat it," said Alice. "If it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key. If it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door. Either way, I'll get into the garden!"

She ate a little bit and waited to see what would happen.
