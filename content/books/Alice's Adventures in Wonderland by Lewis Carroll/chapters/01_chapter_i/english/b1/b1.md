Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice was beginning to get thoroughly bored of sitting by her sister on the riverbank, having absolutely nothing to occupy her time. She had occasionally glanced at the book her sister was reading, but it contained neither pictures nor conversations. "What's the point of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"

The scorching summer day was making her feel drowsy and rather dim-witted. She was debating whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would justify the effort of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes scurried past her.

There was nothing particularly extraordinary about witnessing a rabbit—Alice didn't even find it especially peculiar to hear the Rabbit muttering to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!" Later, upon reflection, it occurred to her that she ought to have found this remarkable, but at the time it all seemed perfectly natural.

However, when the Rabbit actually extracted a watch from its waistcoat pocket, examined it, and then hurried on, Alice leapt to her feet in astonishment. It suddenly dawned on her that she had never before encountered a rabbit possessing either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to extract from it. Consumed by curiosity, she raced across the field in pursuit, arriving just in time to witness it disappear down a sizeable rabbit-hole beneath the hedge.

Without a moment's hesitation, Alice plunged down the hole after it, never once pausing to consider how she might manage to get out again.

The rabbit-hole proceeded straight ahead like a tunnel for some distance before abruptly plunging downward at such a steep angle that Alice had no opportunity to halt her descent before finding herself tumbling down what appeared to be an extraordinarily deep well.

Either the well was remarkably deep, or she was falling with unusual slowness, for she had ample time during her descent to observe her surroundings and contemplate what might happen next. Initially, she attempted to look downward to determine her destination, but it was far too dark to discern anything. Subsequently, she examined the sides of the well, noticing they were lined with cupboards and bookshelves. Scattered about were maps and pictures suspended from pegs.

As she passed one shelf, she seized a jar labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE," only to discover, to her profound disappointment, that it was completely empty. Reluctant to drop it for fear of injuring someone below, she managed to deposit it in one of the cupboards as she fell past.

"Well!" thought Alice to herself. "After experiencing such a tremendous fall as this, I shall regard tumbling down stairs as absolutely trivial! Everyone at home will consider me remarkably brave! Why, I wouldn't even mention it if I fell from the very top of the house!" (Which was probably quite true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall never terminate? "I wonder how many miles I've descended by now?" she said aloud. "I must be approaching somewhere near the center of the earth. Let me calculate: that would be approximately four thousand miles down, I believe." (Alice had absorbed various facts of this nature during her lessons at school, and although this wasn't an particularly appropriate opportunity to demonstrate her knowledge, given the absence of an audience, it remained useful practice to recite it.)

"I wonder what latitude or longitude I've reached?" (Alice possessed no genuine understanding of latitude or longitude, but she considered them impressively sophisticated words to articulate.)

Before long, she began contemplating other matters. "I wonder if I shall fall completely through the earth! How peculiar it will seem to emerge among people who walk about upside-down! The Antipathies, I think—" (She was rather relieved there was no one listening this time, as it didn't sound quite right.) "However, I shall need to inquire what the country is called. Excuse me, Madam, but is this New Zealand or Australia?" (She attempted to curtsey as she spoke. Imagine attempting to curtsey while plummeting through the air! Could you manage such a feat?)

Down, down, down. With nothing else to occupy her, Alice soon resumed speaking aloud. "Dinah will certainly miss me this evening, I should imagine!" (Dinah was the cat.) "I do hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dear Dinah! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, unfortunately, but you might catch a bat, which is remarkably similar to a mouse. But do cats consume bats, I wonder?"

Alice was becoming increasingly drowsy, continuing to murmur to herself in a dreamy manner, "Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?" Occasionally she would say, "Do bats eat cats?" Since she couldn't answer either question, it mattered little which way she phrased it.

She sensed she was drifting off to sleep when suddenly—thump! thump!—she landed upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall concluded.

Alice escaped injury entirely and sprang to her feet immediately. Looking upward, she could see nothing but darkness overhead. Before her stretched another lengthy passage, and the White Rabbit was still visible, hurrying along it. There wasn't a moment to waste. Alice dashed off like the wind, arriving just in time to hear it exclaim, as it rounded a corner, "Oh my ears and whiskers, how terribly late it's getting!"

She was close behind when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit had vanished from sight. She discovered herself in a long, low hall illuminated by a series of lamps suspended from the ceiling.

Doors surrounded the hall on all sides, but every single one was locked. After Alice had traversed the entire length of one side and back along the other, attempting each door, she walked disconsolately down the center, wondering how she could possibly escape.

Unexpectedly, she encountered a small three-legged table constructed entirely of solid glass. Upon it rested nothing but a tiny golden key, and Alice's immediate thought was that it might correspond to one of the hall's doors. However, either the locks proved too large or the key too small—it wouldn't open any of them.

Nevertheless, during her second circuit of the hall, she discovered a low curtain she had previously overlooked. Behind it stood a little door approximately fifteen inches in height. She tested the little golden key in the lock and, to her immense delight, it fitted perfectly!

Alice opened the door and found it led into a narrow passage, scarcely larger than a rat-hole. She knelt down and peered along the passage into what was undoubtedly the most beautiful garden imaginable. How desperately she longed to escape that dismal hall and wander among those beds of vibrant flowers and refreshing fountains! Yet she couldn't even insert her head through the doorway.

"Even if my head would pass through," thought poor Alice, "it would prove rather useless without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could collapse like a telescope! I believe I could, if only I knew the proper method." You see, such an abundance of extraordinary things had occurred recently that Alice had begun to believe that remarkably few things were genuinely impossible.

There seemed little point in lingering by the small door, so she returned to the table, half hoping to discover another key or perhaps a manual of instructions for compressing people like telescopes. This time she found a small bottle present ("which definitely wasn't here previously," observed Alice). Encircling the bottle's neck was a paper label bearing the words "DRINK ME" printed elegantly in large letters.

Saying "Drink me" was all very well, but the prudent little Alice had no intention of acting hastily. "No, I shall examine it first," she declared, "to ascertain whether it's labeled 'poison' or not." She had perused several cautionary tales about children who had suffered burns, been devoured by wild beasts, and experienced other disagreeable fates, all because they neglected to heed the straightforward advice their friends had provided. Such lessons included that a red-hot poker will burn you if grasped too long, and that slicing your finger deeply with a knife typically results in bleeding. She particularly remembered that consuming substantial quantities from a bottle marked "poison" almost invariably proves detrimental sooner or later.

Fortunately, this bottle bore no "poison" marking, so Alice ventured to taste it. Finding it exceptionally pleasant (it possessed a curious combination of flavors—cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast), she rapidly consumed the entire contents.

"What an extraordinary sensation!" exclaimed Alice. "I must be contracting like a telescope!"

Indeed she was. She now measured merely ten inches in height, and her expression brightened at the realization that she had achieved the appropriate dimensions for passing through the little door into that magnificent garden.

Initially, however, she waited several minutes to determine whether she would continue shrinking. She felt somewhat apprehensive about this possibility. "Because it might conclude, you understand," Alice told herself, "with me disappearing entirely, like a candle flame. I wonder what I should resemble then?" She attempted to envision a candle flame's appearance after being extinguished, but couldn't recall ever witnessing such a phenomenon.

After a brief interval, discovering nothing further occurred, she resolved to enter the garden immediately. But unfortunately for poor Alice! Upon reaching the door, she realized she had neglected to retrieve the little golden key, and when she returned to the table to collect it, she found it completely beyond her reach. She could observe it clearly through the glass, and she exerted considerable effort attempting to scale one of the table legs, but it proved excessively slippery. After exhausting herself with repeated attempts, the poor little creature sat down and wept.

"Come now, there's absolutely no benefit in crying like that!" Alice admonished herself quite sternly. "I strongly advise you to cease this instant!" She customarily dispensed excellent advice to herself (though she rarely followed it), and occasionally she reprimanded herself so severely that tears welled up in her eyes. She even recalled one occasion when she had attempted to box her own ears for having cheated herself during a game of croquet she was playing against herself. This peculiar child was extraordinarily fond of pretending to be two distinct people.

"But it's completely futile now," thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be two people! Why, there's scarcely sufficient of me remaining to constitute one respectable person!"

Shortly thereafter, her gaze fell upon a small glass box positioned beneath the table. She opened it and discovered inside a diminutive cake upon which the words "EAT ME" were exquisitely inscribed in currants.

"Very well, I shall eat it," declared Alice, "and if it causes me to grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me smaller, I can crawl beneath the door. Consequently, either outcome will enable me to access the garden, and I'm entirely indifferent as to which occurs!"

She consumed a small portion and anxiously inquired of herself, "Which direction? Which direction?" She placed her hand atop her head to detect which way she was growing, and was considerably surprised to find she remained unchanged. Naturally, this typically occurs when one eats cake, but Alice had become so accustomed to anticipating exclusively extraordinary events that it seemed remarkably mundane and tedious for life to proceed in the conventional manner.

Therefore, she applied herself to the task and promptly finished the entire cake.
