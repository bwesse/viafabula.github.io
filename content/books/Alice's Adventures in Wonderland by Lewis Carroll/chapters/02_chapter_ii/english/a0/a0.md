The Pool of Tears

Alice ate the cake. She started to grow! She grew and grew. She got bigger and bigger!

"Goodbye, feet!" said Alice. Her feet were very far away now. She was so tall! She was more than nine feet tall!

Alice took the little gold key. She went to the garden door. But now she was too big! She could not go through the door. She lay down and looked through with one eye. But she was much too big. Alice sat down and cried.

"Stop crying!" Alice told herself. "You are too big to cry like a baby!" But she kept crying. She cried so much! Her tears made a big pool of water on the floor. The pool was four inches deep!

Then Alice heard small footsteps. It was the White Rabbit! The Rabbit was dressed very nicely. It had white gloves and a fan. The Rabbit was in a hurry. It said, "Oh! The Duchess! She will be very angry if I am late!"

Alice was desperate. She said to the Rabbit, "If you please, sir—" But the Rabbit was scared! It dropped the gloves and fan. Then it ran away into the dark.

Alice picked up the fan and gloves. The hall was very hot. She fanned herself. She said, "How strange everything is today! I wonder if I am still me. Was I the same this morning? I feel different. Maybe I am a different girl now!"

Alice thought about the other girls she knew. "I am not Ada," she said. "Ada has long curly hair. My hair is not curly. And I am not Mabel. Mabel does not know much. I know many things!"

Alice tried to remember things from school. "Let me see. Four times five is... twelve? And four times six is thirteen?" Alice was confused. "That is all wrong! Maybe I am Mabel after all!"

Alice began to cry again. Her eyes filled with tears.

Then Alice noticed something strange. She was holding the Rabbit's glove. How did it fit? She was getting smaller again! The fan was making her shrink! Alice dropped the fan quickly. Just in time! She was now about two feet tall.

Alice was happy she did not disappear. "Now I can go to the garden!" she thought. She ran to the little door. But oh no! The door was shut! And the gold key was on the table again! "This is worse than before!" thought Alice. "I was never this small before! This is too bad!"

As she said this, her foot slipped. Splash! Alice fell into water! She thought she had fallen into the sea! But no—it was the pool of her own tears from when she was nine feet tall!

"I wish I had not cried so much!" said Alice as she swam. "Now I might drown in my own tears! That would be very strange!"

Just then, Alice heard something splashing in the pool. She swam closer to see what it was. At first she thought it might be a big animal like a walrus or a hippopotamus. But then she remembered how small she was now. It was just a mouse that had fallen in!

"Would it help," thought Alice, "to talk to this mouse? Everything is so strange here. Maybe it can talk. I will try." So she said, "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming!"

The Mouse looked at her but said nothing.

"Perhaps it does not understand English," thought Alice. "Maybe it is a French mouse!" So she said in French, "Where is my cat?" (This was the first sentence in her French book.)

The Mouse jumped! It looked very scared! "Oh, I am sorry!" said Alice. "I forgot you do not like cats!"

"Not like cats!" cried the Mouse in a loud voice. "Would you like cats if you were me?"

"Well, perhaps not," said Alice nicely. "Don't be angry. But I wish you could see my cat Dinah. She is very sweet. She sits by the fire and purrs. She washes her face. She is so soft! And she is very good at catching mice—oh, I am sorry!" Alice said. The Mouse looked very angry again.

"We will not talk about cats anymore!" said the Mouse, shaking with fear. "My family hates cats! Do not say that word again!"

"I won't!" said Alice quickly. "Do you—do you like—dogs?" The Mouse did not answer. So Alice said, "There is a nice little dog near my house. It is a terrier. It has long curly brown hair! It fetches things. It sits up and begs. It does many tricks! It belongs to a farmer. The farmer says it is very useful. He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!" said Alice sadly. "I think I made you angry again!" The Mouse was swimming away as fast as it could.

Alice called softly, "Mouse dear! Please come back! We will not talk about cats or dogs!" When the Mouse heard this, it turned around and swam slowly back to Alice. Its face was pale. It said in a quiet voice, "Let us go to the shore. Then I will tell you my story. You will understand why I hate cats and dogs."

It was time to go. The pool was getting crowded with birds and animals that had fallen into it. There were a Duck, a Dodo, a Lory, an Eaglet, and several other strange creatures. Alice led the way, and they all swam to the shore together.
