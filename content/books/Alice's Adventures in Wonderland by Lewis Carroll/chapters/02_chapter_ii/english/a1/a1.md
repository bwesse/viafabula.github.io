The Pool of Tears

"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice. She was so surprised that she forgot to speak properly. "Now I'm growing like the biggest telescope ever! Goodbye, feet!" When she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight. They were getting so far away!

"Oh, my poor little feet," said Alice. "I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now? I certainly won't be able to! I shall be much too far away to worry about you. You must manage the best way you can. But I must be kind to them," thought Alice, "or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas."

She went on planning how she would manage it. "They must go by carrier," she thought. "And how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how strange the address will look!"

Just then her head hit the roof of the hall. In fact, she was now more than nine feet high! She quickly took up the little golden key and hurried to the garden door.

Poor Alice! She could only lie down on one side and look through into the garden with one eye. But getting through was even more hopeless than before. She sat down and began to cry again.

"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice, "a big girl like you, crying like this! Stop at once, I tell you!" But she went on crying anyway, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all around her, about four inches deep and reaching halfway down the hall.

After some time, she heard the sound of little footsteps in the distance. She quickly dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He came along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, "Oh! The Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! Won't she be angry if I've kept her waiting!"

Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask anyone for help. So when the Rabbit came near her, she began in a low, timid voice, "If you please, sir—"

The Rabbit jumped violently, dropped the white gloves and the fan, and ran away into the darkness as fast as he could go.

Alice picked up the fan and gloves. The hall was very hot, so she kept fanning herself while she talked. "Dear, dear! How strange everything is today! Yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I felt a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is: Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!"

She began thinking about all the children she knew who were the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

"I'm sure I'm not Ada," she said, "because her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all. And I'm sure I can't be Mabel, because I know all sorts of things, and she knows very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is!"

"I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't matter. Let's try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that's all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for Mabel!"

Alice's eyes filled with tears again as she went on, "I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that tiny little house, and have almost no toys to play with, and oh! so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it. If I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use them saying 'Come up again, dear!' I shall only look up and say 'Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up. If not, I'll stay down here until I'm somebody else!'"

"But oh dear!" cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears. "I do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!"

As she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white gloves while she was talking. "How can I have done that?" she thought. "I must be growing small again."

She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it. She found that she was now about two feet high and was shrinking rapidly. She soon discovered that the cause was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it quickly, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

"That was a narrow escape!" said Alice, very frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still alive. "And now for the garden!" She ran as fast as she could back to the little door. But alas! The little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before. "Things are worse than ever," thought the poor child, "because I've never been so small as this before, never! And I must say it's too bad!"

As she said these words, her foot slipped, and splash! She was up to her chin in salt water. Her first thought was that she had somehow fallen into the sea. "In that case I can go back by railway," she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life.) However, she soon realized that she was in the pool of tears which she had cried when she was nine feet high.

"I wish I hadn't cried so much!" said Alice as she swam about, trying to find her way out. "I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a strange thing, to be sure! However, everything is strange today."

Just then she heard something splashing in the pool a little way off. She swam nearer to see what it was. At first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon realized it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

"Would it be any use now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse? Everything is so unusual down here that I should think it's very likely it can talk. At any rate, there's no harm in trying."

So she began: "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!" (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse. She had never done such a thing before, but she remembered seeing in her brother's Latin Grammar, "A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!")

The Mouse looked at her rather curiously and seemed to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.

"Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice. "I expect it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror." (Despite all her knowledge of history, Alice had no clear idea how long ago anything had happened.)

So she began again: "Où est ma chatte?" which was the first sentence in her French lesson book.

The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to shake all over with fright. "Oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice quickly, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. "I quite forgot you didn't like cats."

"Not like cats!" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. "Would you like cats if you were me?"

"Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone. "Don't be angry about it. But I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you'd like cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing," Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam slowly about in the pool. "She sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face. And she is such a nice soft thing to hold. And she's so good at catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice again, because this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she was certain it must be really offended.

"We won't talk about her anymore if you'd rather not."

"We indeed!" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. "As if I would talk about such a subject! Our family always hated cats—nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear that name again!"

"I won't indeed!" said Alice, very eager to change the subject. "Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?"

The Mouse didn't answer, so Alice went on eagerly: "There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things. I can't remember half of them. And it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. "I'm afraid I've offended it again!"

The Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

Alice called softly after it, "Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!"

When the Mouse heard this, it turned around and swam slowly back to her. Its face was quite pale (with anger, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, "Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."

It was high time to go, because the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it. There were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
