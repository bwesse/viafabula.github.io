# Building the Blackbirds

We work in the lab. We build drones.

The drones have names. Blackbird. Goldeneye. Phoenix.

I design. I use a computer. Tim writes code.

It is hard. The drones crash. We learn.

One drone flies. Then two. Then three.

We are tired. We work late. We eat pizza.

The drones are ready. We go to London.
