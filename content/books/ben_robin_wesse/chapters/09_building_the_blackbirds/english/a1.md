# Building the Blackbirds

The drone lab was our home. Tim and I worked there every day.

We built three drones. We called them Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix.

I designed the drones on the computer. I used a program called Fusion 360. My art skills helped me see how parts fit together.

It was hard work. We learned about motors and batteries. The drones crashed many times. Once, a battery started a fire!

But we learned from every mistake. After three months, the drones could fly. After four months, they flew alone.

The deadline was coming. We worked all night. We ate pizza and drank coffee.

Finally, the drones were ready for London. They were not perfect, but they could fly.
