# Building the Blackbirds

The drone lab became our world. For months, Tim and I lived there more than our apartments.

Blackbird. Goldeneye. Phoenix. Three names, three drones, three monsters of carbon fiber and ambition.

I was responsible for the physical design and construction. Fusion 360 became my new canvas—instead of paint and brushes, I worked with CAD models and 3D printers. My art background, surprisingly, helped. I could visualize how parts would fit together, how forces would flow through structures.

The learning curve was brutal. Motor specifications, propeller efficiency, battery capacity, sensor integration—every component required hours of research. We made mistakes. Lots of mistakes. Early prototypes crashed into walls, fell from the sky, and once, memorably, set a battery on fire.

But with each failure, we learned. Each crash taught us something about aerodynamics, about weight distribution, about the unforgiving physics of flight. By the third month, our drones were stable. By the fourth, they were autonomous.

The competition deadline loomed. We were behind schedule, behind on code, behind on everything. But we kept working. All-nighters became routine. The team office filled with energy drinks and pizza boxes.

When we finally packed the drones for London, they weren't perfect. The code had bugs. The hardware had weaknesses. But they flew. And that was enough to start.
