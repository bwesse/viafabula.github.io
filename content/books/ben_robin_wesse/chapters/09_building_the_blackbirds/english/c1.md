# Building the Blackbirds

The drone laboratory gradually metamorphosed into our entire existence. Throughout those interminable months, Tim and I virtually inhabited that fluorescent-lit workspace, spending exponentially more waking hours amidst the humming equipment than within the confines of our respective apartments. Our circadian rhythms adapted to the irregular cadence of deadline-driven development.

From this sustained immersion emerged three remarkable machines, each bearing a designation that captured our collective aspirations: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix. These weren't simplistic quadcopters—they represented sophisticated amalgamations of carbon fiber airframes, precision motors, and intricate sensor arrays, engineering marvels designed to navigate autonomously through complex search-and-rescue scenarios.

My principal responsibilities encompassed the physical design and fabrication processes. Fusion 360 supplanted my previous artistic tools, transforming into a digital canvas where CAD models replaced watercolors and 3D printers substituted for brushstrokes. Remarkably, my background in visual arts—cultivated during those formative years studying for my Abitur—proved unexpectedly advantageous. I possessed an intuitive capacity to visualize spatial relationships, to conceptualize how disparate components would integrate harmoniously, to anticipate how mechanical stresses would propagate through structural geometries.

The learning trajectory proved unrelentingly steep. Motor specifications, propeller efficiency coefficients, battery capacity optimization, sensor integration protocols—every individual component necessitated exhaustive research and experimentation. We accumulated failures systematically. Embryonic prototypes collided catastrophically with walls, plummeted uncontrollably from testing altitudes, and on one particularly memorable afternoon, initiated a lithium polymer battery fire that necessitated emergency evacuation procedures.

Nevertheless, each catastrophe constituted an education. Every crash elucidated some previously obscure aerodynamic principle, illuminated some overlooked consideration regarding weight distribution, reinforced some immutable law governing the physics of rotary-wing flight. By the third month, our drones achieved consistent stability. By the fourth, they operated with genuine autonomy, executing complex decision trees without human intervention.

The competition deadline materialized with inexorable inevitability, casting an increasingly ominous shadow across our endeavors. We remained chronically behind schedule—behind on software development, behind on hardware refinement, behind on virtually every conceivable metric. Nevertheless, capitulation was never contemplated. All-nighters transitioned from exceptional occurrences to mundane routine. The team office accumulated stratified deposits of pizza boxes and energy drink containers.

When we ultimately secured the drones for transport to London, perfection remained an unrealized aspiration. The codebase harbored unresolved bugs. The hardware exhibited acknowledged vulnerabilities. Yet the fundamental threshold was satisfied—the machines achieved reliable flight. That baseline capability would constitute our foundation.
