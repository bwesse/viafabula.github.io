# Building the Blackbirds

The drone lab became our second home. For several months, Tim and I spent more time there than in our apartments.

We were building three drones and we gave them names: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix. Each drone was made of carbon fiber, which is very light and strong.

I was in charge of designing and building the drones. I used a computer program called Fusion 360 to create the designs. My art background from high school was surprisingly helpful. I could imagine how the different parts would fit together.

Learning about drones was very difficult. We had to study about motors, propellers, batteries, and sensors. We made many mistakes in the beginning. Our first drones crashed into walls and fell from the sky. Once, a battery even caught fire!

But every mistake taught us something new. After three months, our drones could fly without problems. After four months, they could fly by themselves without a pilot.

The deadline for the competition was getting close. We were behind on everything. But we continued to work hard. We worked all night many times. Our office was full of empty pizza boxes and energy drinks.

When we finally packed the drones for London, they weren't perfect. There were still some problems with the code and hardware. But the drones could fly, and that was a good start.
