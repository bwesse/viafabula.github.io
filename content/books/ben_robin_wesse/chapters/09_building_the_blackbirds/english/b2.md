# Building the Blackbirds

The drone lab gradually transformed into our entire universe. For months on end, Tim and I practically inhabited that space, spending far more hours there than in our respective apartments. The rhythms of our lives synchronized with the hum of 3D printers and the whir of testing propellers.

Three drones emerged from our efforts, each christened with a name that reflected our ambitions: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix. These weren't mere toys—they were intricate machines of carbon fiber and cutting-edge electronics, monsters of engineering that would need to navigate autonomously through complex rescue scenarios.

My responsibilities centered on the physical design and construction phase. Fusion 360 became my new canvas, replacing the paint and brushes I'd used back in my art school days. Instead of creating visual compositions, I now crafted CAD models and fed them to 3D printers. Surprisingly, my artistic background proved genuinely advantageous—I could intuitively visualize how components would integrate, how stress would distribute through structures, how form could follow function.

The learning curve proved brutally steep. Motor specifications, propeller efficiency calculations, battery capacity optimization, sensor integration protocols—every single component demanded hours of meticulous research. We stumbled constantly. Our early prototypes crashed spectacularly into walls, plummeted uncontrollably from the sky, and on one particularly memorable occasion, triggered a battery fire that nearly evacuated the building.

Yet each catastrophe served as an education. Every crash illuminated some aspect of aerodynamics we'd overlooked, some principle of weight distribution we'd neglected, some unforgiving law of physics we'd attempted to defy. By the third month, our drones achieved stability. By the fourth, they operated autonomously, making decisions without human intervention.

The competition deadline loomed ever closer, casting a shadow over our progress. We remained hopelessly behind schedule—behind on code, behind on testing, behind on virtually everything. Nevertheless, we persisted relentlessly. All-nighters became routine rather than exceptional. The team office accumulated empty pizza boxes and energy drink cans like archaeological strata.

When we finally packed the drones for London, perfection remained elusive. The code harbored bugs we hadn't resolved. The hardware displayed weaknesses we hadn't addressed. But the fundamental criterion was met—they flew reliably. And that baseline capability would have to suffice.
