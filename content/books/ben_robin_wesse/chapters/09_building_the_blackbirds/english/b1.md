# Building the Blackbirds

The drone lab practically became our home. For months on end, Tim and I spent more time there than in our own apartments, working day and night on our creations.

We built three drones and gave them memorable names: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix. Each was constructed from carbon fiber—lightweight but incredibly strong—and represented months of learning and experimentation.

My role was the physical design and construction. I used Fusion 360, a CAD program, as my new creative tool. Instead of paint and brushes, I now worked with digital models and 3D printers. Surprisingly, my art background turned out to be useful here. I could visualize how different parts would connect and how forces would move through the structures.

The learning process was extremely challenging. We had to understand motor specifications, propeller efficiency, battery capacity, and sensor integration—each component required hours of research. We made countless mistakes along the way. Our early prototypes crashed into walls, dropped from the sky, and on one memorable occasion, even set a battery on fire.

However, every failure taught us something valuable. Each crash gave us new understanding about aerodynamics, weight distribution, and the harsh physics of flight. By the third month, our drones were flying steadily. By the fourth, they could operate autonomously without human control.

The competition deadline was approaching quickly, and we were behind schedule on everything—the design, the code, the testing. But we refused to give up. Working through the night became normal, and the office was constantly filled with empty pizza boxes and energy drink cans.

When we finally packed the drones for London, they weren't perfect. There were still bugs in the code and weaknesses in the hardware. But they flew reliably, and that was enough to compete.
