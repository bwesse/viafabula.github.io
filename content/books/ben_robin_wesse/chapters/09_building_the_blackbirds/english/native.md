# Building the Blackbirds

The drone lab basically became our whole life. Tim and I practically lived there for months—way more than we were ever at our actual apartments.

We built three drones and gave them some pretty cool names: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix. Carbon fiber beasts, really. Each one was this crazy mix of ambition and engineering that we barely understood when we started.

I handled all the design and building stuff. Fusion 360 became my new art program—like, instead of sketching and painting, I was doing CAD models and 3D printing. Weirdly, my art background from high school actually helped a ton. I could kind of see how parts would fit together, visualize the whole structure in my head before building it.

Man, the learning curve was insane though. Motors, propellers, batteries, sensors—every single component took hours of research to understand. And we messed up constantly. Our early prototypes crashed into everything, just dropped out of the sky randomly, and once we literally set a battery on fire. Good times.

But here's the thing—we learned from every single crash. Each disaster taught us something new about how drones actually fly. By month three, they were stable. By month four, they flew themselves.

The deadline kept getting closer and we were behind on literally everything. But we just kept grinding. All-nighters became normal. The office was basically a graveyard of pizza boxes and energy drinks.

When we finally packed everything for London, the drones weren't perfect—code had bugs, hardware had issues. But they flew. And honestly? That was enough to get started.
