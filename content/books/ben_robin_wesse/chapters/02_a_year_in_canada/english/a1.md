# A Year in Canada

During high school, Ben had a special opportunity.
He could spend one year in Canada as an exchange student.
Ben was excited and a bit scared.

He flew across the Atlantic Ocean.
It was his first big trip alone.
He landed in a country very different from Germany.

Canada was huge compared to Germany.
The forests seemed endless.
The lakes were enormous.
And the winters were much colder than in Hamburg.

Ben lived with a Canadian host family.
They were very kind to him.
They helped him learn about their culture.
They taught him about hockey and maple syrup.

At first, everything was difficult.
Ben's English was not perfect.
He missed his parents and friends.
The food was different.
The customs were strange.

But week after week, things got easier.
Ben made friends at school.
He started to understand the Canadian way of life.
He even learned to enjoy the long, snowy winters.

The experience changed Ben forever.
He learned that he could adapt to new places.
He learned that the world was full of kind people.
Most importantly, he learned that he wanted to see more of it.

When the year ended, Ben returned to Hamburg.
But a part of him stayed in Canada.
And a bigger part of him now dreamed of future adventures.
