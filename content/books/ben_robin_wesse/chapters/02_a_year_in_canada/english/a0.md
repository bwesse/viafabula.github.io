# A Year in Canada

Ben went to Canada.
He was a student there.
He lived with a family.

Canada is very big.
It has forests and lakes.
The winters are very cold.

Ben learned many new things.
He learned about a different culture.
He made new friends.

At first, it was hard.
Ben missed his home.
He missed his family.

But soon, he felt better.
He liked Canada.
He liked the people.

The year passed quickly.
Ben was sad to leave.
But he knew he would travel more.

Canada taught him something important.
The world is big.
He could go anywhere.
