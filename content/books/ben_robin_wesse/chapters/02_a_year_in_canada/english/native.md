# A Year in Canada

My year in Canada happened because of a pamphlet. Some organization was offering exchange programs, and my parents thought it might be good for me. "You need to see the world," my dad said. What he probably meant was, "You need to stop taking apart my electronics," but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

So there I was, sixteen years old, boarding a plane to a country I knew almost nothing about. Sure, I'd seen the movies. Mountains, maple syrup, weirdly polite people. What I wasn't prepared for was the scale of everything. Canada is absolutely massive. You can drive for eight hours and still be in the same province. In Germany, eight hours gets you to like four different countries.

My host family was great. Really, genuinely nice people who had no idea what they were getting into with me. I showed up barely speaking English—despite years of classes, actual conversations with actual Canadians were completely different. For the first few weeks, I mostly nodded and smiled while internally panicking about missing everything.

But here's the thing about immersion: eventually, your brain stops fighting and starts adapting. By month three, I could understand most conversations. By month six, I was thinking in English. By the end, I was dreaming in it. That's when you know you've crossed some kind of threshold.

School in Canada was weirdly chill compared to Germany. Teachers wanted to have discussions! Students could disagree with things! Nobody seemed to care about memorizing facts for the sake of memorizing facts! It was kind of amazing, honestly. All the stuff that made me a frustrating student in Germany suddenly made me an engaged participant in Canada.

But the real education happened outside school. My host brothers took me camping in the actual wilderness—not some managed forest with marked trails, but real backcountry where you had to know what you were doing. I learned to canoe, to set up camp, to navigate by landmarks instead of GPS. It was completely different from anything Hamburg had offered.

And then winter came. Oh, winter. Canadian winters are no joke. I'm talking minus thirty, minus forty with wind chill. The kind of cold that hurts your face. But Canadians don't hide from it—they embrace it. They ski, they skate, they build entire activities around frozen lakes. That's where I discovered snowboarding, which would later become one of the most important parts of my life.

Leaving was harder than I expected. I'd made real friends, developed real connections. The host family had become like a second family. But I knew I couldn't stay, and part of me didn't want to. Canada had taught me something crucial: I could adapt anywhere. I could land in an unfamiliar place and figure it out.

That knowledge was going to be useful. Because I had two more years of high school, and after that, I intended to keep exploring. Canada was just the appetizer.

The main course was still coming.
