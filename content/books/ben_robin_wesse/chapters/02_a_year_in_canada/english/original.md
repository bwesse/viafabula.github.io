# A Year in Canada

I was sixteen when I left Hamburg for a year in Canada. Looking back, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made—even though I had no idea at the time just how much it would change me.

The exchange program matched me with a host family in a mid-sized Canadian city. They had two kids of their own and treated me like a third. From day one, they were patient with my broken English, my confused expressions when they referenced TV shows I'd never seen, my inability to understand why everyone was so obsessed with hockey.

Let me tell you about Canadian English: it's not like what they teach you in school. At all. I'd spent years learning vocabulary and grammar, thinking I was pretty good. Then I landed in Canada and realized I couldn't follow a single casual conversation. Too fast, too much slang, too many references I didn't get. For weeks, I just smiled and nodded while secretly having no clue what was happening.

But brains are amazing things. Mine eventually figured it out. The switch happened so gradually I almost didn't notice—until one day I realized I wasn't translating anymore. English was just... happening. Naturally. I'd even started dreaming in English, which is such a weird experience when you think about it.

School was different too. German schools are all about memorizing information and regurgitating it on tests. Canadian schools actually wanted us to discuss things. To have opinions. To question what we were learning. It was revolutionary for someone like me who'd spent years annoying German teachers with too many questions.

But the real Canada—the part that stayed with me—was the outdoors. My host brothers took me camping, canoeing, hiking. We went to places where there was no cell signal for days. Where the only sounds were wind and water and occasionally something moving in the forest that was probably (hopefully) not a bear. I fell in love with nature in a way that Hamburg, for all its charms, could never have inspired.

And winter. Canadian winter nearly killed me at first. I'd thought Hamburg winters were cold. I was wrong. Canadian cold is a different species entirely—the kind that freezes your nostrils together if you breathe too fast. But Canadians don't hide from it. They embrace it. They ski, they skate, they ice fish. I learned to snowboard that year, and it became something that would shape many decisions down the road.

When it was time to leave, I cried. Actual tears, which is embarrassing to admit but true. I'd built a life there, made friendships that felt permanent, become part of a family that wasn't mine by blood but was mine in every other way.

But I also knew this was just the beginning. Canada had proven something to me: I could go anywhere and be okay. Better than okay. I could thrive. That knowledge was going to be important.

Because after graduation, I wasn't planning to stay put.

The world was waiting.
