# Interrail Adventure

Easter break arrived, and Tim had an exciting idea: "Let's travel to Istanbul by train!"

We bought an Interrail pass. We planned to visit five countries in ten days. Our route went from Klagenfurt to Vienna, then Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, and finally Istanbul.

The trip was chaotic but wonderful.

Each city was different. Vienna was grand and had great coffee. Budapest had thermal baths next to the Danube river. Bucharest mixed old and new buildings. Sofia sat under beautiful mountains. Istanbul was incredible—where Europe meets Asia.

We traveled light. We slept on trains when possible. We ate cheap food and talked to strangers. A Romanian student told us about politics. A Turkish businessman shared tea with us.

After Istanbul, I still had train rides left. So I went to Italy. Venice, Florence, Rome—these cities became my second education.

This traveling taught me something important. Klagenfurt wasn't just about mountains and lakes. It was perfectly located to explore Europe.

I was becoming someone who felt at home in many places.
