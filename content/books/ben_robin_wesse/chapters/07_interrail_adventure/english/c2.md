# Interrail Adventure

The vernal equinox had scarcely passed when Tim, with characteristic spontaneity, proposed an audacious expedition: the conquest of Istanbul by rail.

We eschewed the prosaic convenience of aviation in favour of a more peripatetic approach—ten days traversing five sovereign nations, our passage facilitated by a single Interrail ticket. From Klagenfurt we would journey through Vienna, thence to Budapest, onwards to Bucharest, subsequently Sofia, and ultimately to that magnificent confluence of continents: Istanbul. A trajectory slicing through the Balkans like an arrow loosed towards Byzantium.

The expedition proved simultaneously precipitous, tumultuous, and unutterably sublime.

Each metropolitan centre proffered its distinctive character. Vienna, resplendent with Hapsburg grandeur and the intoxicating aroma of its storied Kaffeehäuser. Budapest, that bifurcated jewel astride the Danube, where thermal waters ascend in vaporous plumes against the crepuscular sky. Bucharest, a palimpsest of Ceaușescu's brutalist monuments overlaid upon Belle Époque boulevards. Sofia, ensconced beneath the Vitosha massif, its Orthodox domes gleaming with auriferous magnificence. And Istanbul—that incomparable metropolis where Occident embraces Orient, where millennia of history accumulate in stratified profusion.

We voyaged with minimal impedimenta, slumbering upon railway carriages when circumstances permitted, subsisting upon modest provisions, engaging in discourse with fellow wayfarers. These colloquies proved as edifying as the destinations themselves: a Romanian student elucidating the Byzantine intricacies of his nation's political landscape, a Turkish merchant dispensing çay and Sufi-inflected philosophy, peripatetic compatriots exchanging sagacious counsel.

Following our sojourn in Istanbul, surplus journeys remained upon my pass. Rather than returning directly to Klagenfurt, I permitted myself a Mediterranean diversion. Throughout the ensuing semester, whenever academic obligations permitted respite, I would embark southward. Venice, Florence, Rome—these Italian capitals became my supplementary curriculum.

These peregrinations accomplished something of profound significance: they elucidated the wisdom of my original choice. Klagenfurt's geographic situation transcended mere proximity to alpine slopes and lacustrine waters. It represented accessibility—to multifarious cultures, to sundry nations, to experiences that would have remained forever inaccessible from a more sequestered institution.

I was metamorphosing into a cosmopolitan soul, one whose sense of belonging diffused across multiple coordinates of existence.
