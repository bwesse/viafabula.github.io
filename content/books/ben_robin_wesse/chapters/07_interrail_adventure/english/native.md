# Interrail Adventure

Easter break came, and Tim had an idea: "Let's go to Istanbul by train."

Ten days. Five countries. One Interrail pass. Klagenfurt to Vienna to Budapest to Bucharest to Sofia to Istanbul.

It was crazy, fast, and amazing.

Every city was different. Vienna was elegant with great coffee. Budapest had thermal baths by the river. Bucharest mixed old and new. Sofia had golden churches. Istanbul blew our minds—Europe meets Asia there.

We traveled light, slept on trains, ate street food, talked to everyone. A Romanian guy explained politics. A Turkish businessman shared tea. Backpackers shared tips.

After Istanbul, I had rides left. So I went to Italy—Venice, Florence, Rome. Those cities taught me so much.

This is why I picked Klagenfurt. It's not just mountains and lakes. It's the perfect spot to explore Europe.

I was becoming someone who belongs everywhere.
