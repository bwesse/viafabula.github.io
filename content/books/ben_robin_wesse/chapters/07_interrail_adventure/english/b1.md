# Interrail Adventure

Easter break arrived, and Tim had an idea: "Let's go to Istanbul."

Not by plane—that would be too simple. By train. Ten days, five countries, one Interrail pass. Klagenfurt to Vienna to Budapest to Bucharest to Sofia to Istanbul. A straight line through the Balkans.

It was rushed, chaotic, and absolutely perfect.

Each city offered something different. Vienna with its imperial grandeur and coffee culture. Budapest straddling the Danube, thermal baths steaming in the cold air. Bucharest's mix of Communist concrete and Belle Époque elegance. Sofia nestled beneath mountains, Orthodox churches gleaming gold. And Istanbul—the city where Europe meets Asia, where centuries of history pile on top of each other.

We traveled light, slept on trains when we could, ate cheap food, talked to strangers. The conversations mattered as much as the destinations: a Romanian student explaining his country's politics, a Turkish businessman sharing tea and philosophy, fellow backpackers exchanging tips and stories.

After Istanbul, I still had rides left on my ticket. Instead of going straight back to Klagenfurt, I detoured through Italy. The Mediterranean called. Throughout that second semester, whenever I had a few days free, I'd hop on a train south. Venice, Florence, Rome—the Italian cities became my second classroom.

These travels did something important: they reminded me why I'd chosen Klagenfurt in the first place. The location wasn't just about mountains and lakes. It was about access—to cultures, to countries, to experiences that would have been impossible from a more isolated university.

I was becoming someone who belonged in multiple places at once.
