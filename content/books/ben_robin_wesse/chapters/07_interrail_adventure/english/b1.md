# Interrail Adventure

When Easter break arrived, Tim came up with a brilliant plan: "Let's take the train to Istanbul."

Not by plane—that would be too easy. We decided to travel by train for ten days, crossing five countries with a single Interrail pass. Our route would take us from Klagenfurt through Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, and finally to Istanbul—a straight line through the Balkans.

The journey was rushed, chaotic, and absolutely perfect.

Each city offered us something unique. Vienna impressed us with its imperial architecture and coffee culture. Budapest sat beautifully on both sides of the Danube, with thermal baths steaming in the cool air. Bucharest surprised us with its mix of Communist-era buildings and elegant Belle Époque streets. Sofia nestled beneath mountains, its Orthodox churches shining with golden domes. And Istanbul—that magical city where Europe meets Asia, where thousands of years of history overlap.

We traveled light, slept on trains whenever we could, ate cheap street food, and talked to strangers. The conversations were just as valuable as the destinations: a Romanian student explained his country's complex politics, a Turkish businessman shared tea and philosophy, fellow backpackers exchanged travel tips and stories.

After Istanbul, I still had unused journeys on my ticket. Instead of returning directly to Klagenfurt, I made a detour through Italy. The Mediterranean was calling me. Throughout that second semester, whenever I had a few free days, I would hop on a train heading south. Venice, Florence, Rome—these Italian cities became my second classroom.

These travels taught me something important: they reminded me why I had chosen Klagenfurt in the first place. The location wasn't just about mountains and lakes. It was about having access to so many cultures and countries—experiences that would have been impossible from a more isolated university.

I was becoming someone who felt at home in multiple places at once.
