# Interrail Adventure

It is Easter. Tim has an idea.

"Let's go to Istanbul," he says.

We take trains. We go to many cities. Vienna. Budapest. Bucharest. Sofia. Istanbul.

The trip is ten days. We see five countries. It is fun.

Vienna is big. Budapest has baths. Istanbul is amazing.

We sleep on trains. We eat cheap food. We talk to people.

After Istanbul, I go to Italy. I see Venice. I see Rome.

I like to travel. Klagenfurt is good for this.
