# Interrail Adventure

It was Easter. Tim had an idea.

"Let's go to Istanbul," he said.

We went by train. Ten days. Five countries. Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, Istanbul.

The trip was fast and fun.

Vienna was beautiful. Budapest had hot baths. Bucharest was interesting. Sofia had mountains. Istanbul was amazing.

We slept on trains. We ate cheap food. We talked to many people.

After Istanbul, I went to Italy. I saw Venice, Florence, and Rome.

I loved traveling. Klagenfurt was a good place for this.
