# Interrail Adventure

Easter break arrived, and Tim had a characteristically spontaneous idea: "Let's make our way to Istanbul—by train."

Not by plane—that would have been far too straightforward. By rail, traversing five nations over ten days with a single Interrail pass. Klagenfurt to Vienna, onwards to Budapest, then Bucharest, Sofia, and finally Istanbul. A direct trajectory cutting through the heart of the Balkans.

The journey proved to be rushed, chaotic, and utterly sublime.

Each metropolis offered its own distinctive character. Vienna with its imperial grandeur and sophisticated coffee house culture. Budapest straddling the Danube, its thermal baths sending steam into the crisp air. Bucharest presenting an intriguing juxtaposition of Communist-era concrete and refined Belle Époque elegance. Sofia nestled beneath its mountain backdrop, Orthodox churches crowned with gleaming golden domes. And Istanbul—that extraordinary city where Europe seamlessly merges with Asia, where countless centuries of history have accumulated in layers upon layers.

We traveled with minimal luggage, catching sleep on trains whenever possible, sustaining ourselves on affordable street food, striking up conversations with complete strangers. These exchanges proved equally rewarding as the destinations themselves: a Romanian student patiently explaining his nation's intricate political landscape, a Turkish businessman generously sharing tea and philosophical insights, fellow backpackers exchanging invaluable tips and captivating stories.

After our time in Istanbul, I still had remaining journeys on my pass. Rather than heading straight back to Klagenfurt, I allowed myself a Mediterranean detour. Throughout the remainder of that semester, whenever academic obligations permitted, I would catch a train heading south. Venice, Florence, Rome—these Italian cities became an extension of my education.

These extensive travels accomplished something significant: they reinforced exactly why I had chosen Klagenfurt as my base. The location transcended mere proximity to mountains and lakes. It was fundamentally about accessibility—to diverse cultures, to neighboring nations, to experiences that would have remained entirely out of reach from a more geographically isolated institution.

I was gradually transforming into someone capable of belonging in multiple places simultaneously.
