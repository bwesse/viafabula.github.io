# Preparing for Huntsville

London lit a fire under us. Second place was great and all, but we weren't satisfied—we wanted that first place trophy.

Next up was Huntsville, Alabama. Way bigger scenario this time: outdoor flying, longer distances, the whole deal. Everything needed to be scaled up massively.

So I made a tough call—I bailed on my Erasmus plans. Barcelona could wait. The drones couldn't.

From September on, prep basically consumed my entire life. I spent insane hours at the team office, designing the new quadcopters in Fusion 360. We named them RED and BULL because, well, that's the only filament color we had lying around.

These things had to be way bigger than anything we'd built before. Bigger props for more lift. Bigger batteries for longer flight time. More sensors for outdoor nav. Every decision led to like a dozen more decisions.

The design grind went all the way through Easter. Then came the build phase—even more intense. I had the 3D printers running nonstop, day and night. RED came together first and passed all the flight tests no problem. BULL was ready shortly after.

Then everything went sideways. During late testing, our supervisors handed us these bigger batteries we hadn't planned for. The extra weight messed everything up—both drones crashed hard.

I pulled a bunch of all-nighters fixing everything. More parts printed. More calibration. More testing. By the time we packed for Alabama, I was basically running on pure caffeine and stubbornness.

But hey, we were ready. As ready as we'd ever be.
