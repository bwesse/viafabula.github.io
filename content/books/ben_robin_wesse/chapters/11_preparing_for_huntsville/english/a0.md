# Preparing for Huntsville

London was good. But we want to win.

The next competition is in Alabama. The drones need to be bigger.

I cancel my Barcelona plans. I stay to work.

I design new drones. They are called RED and BULL.

I print parts. I work day and night.

RED flies first. Then BULL flies.

We have crashes. The batteries are too heavy.

I fix the drones. I am tired. But we are ready.
