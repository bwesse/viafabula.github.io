# Preparing for Huntsville

London lit a fire in us. Second place was good, but not good enough.

The next competition would be in Huntsville, Alabama. Bigger scenario, outdoor flying, longer distances. Everything needed to be scaled up.

I canceled my Erasmus plans. Barcelona could wait. The drones couldn't.

From September, the preparation consumed everything. I spent countless hours in our team office, designing the new quadcopters in Fusion 360. RED and BULL—those were their names, born from the limited 3D printing filament we had available.

These drones needed to be bigger than anything we'd built before. Larger props for more lift. Bigger batteries for longer flight time. More sensors for outdoor navigation. Each decision cascaded into dozens of others.

The design phase stretched through Easter. Then came the build phase—even more intense. I printed parts around the clock, our 3D printers running day and night. RED came together first, passing initial flight tests with flying colors. BULL followed shortly after.

Then disaster struck. Late testing with larger batteries—supplied by our supervisors—caused crashes. The heavier weight made our drones unstable. Both crashed hard.

I pulled all-nighters to fix everything. More parts printed. More calibration. More testing. By the time we packed for Alabama, I was running on caffeine and stubbornness.

But we were ready. As ready as we'd ever be.
