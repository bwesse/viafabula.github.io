# Preparing for Huntsville

London gave us motivation. Second place was good, but not enough for us. We wanted to win first place.

The next competition was in Huntsville, Alabama. This time, the drones had to fly outside over longer distances. Everything needed to be bigger and better.

I decided to cancel my Erasmus exchange to Barcelona. The drones were more important, and I could go to Barcelona later.

From September, I spent many hours in our team office. I designed the new drones using Fusion 360 on the computer. We named them RED and BULL because we only had red 3D printing material.

These drones were much bigger than the ones before. They had larger propellers so they could carry more weight. They had bigger batteries so they could fly longer. They had more sensors so they could fly outside.

The design phase continued until Easter. Then we started building the drones. The 3D printers ran all day and all night. RED was ready first and passed all the flight tests. BULL was ready soon after.

But then we had a big problem. Our supervisors gave us heavier batteries than we planned for. The extra weight made the drones unstable, and both crashed badly.

I worked through the night to fix everything. I printed more parts and did more tests. By the time we left for Alabama, I was very tired but running on coffee and determination.

But we were finally ready for the competition.
