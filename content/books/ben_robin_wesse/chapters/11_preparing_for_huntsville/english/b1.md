# Preparing for Huntsville

London had ignited something in us. Getting second place was satisfying, but it wasn't enough—we wanted to prove we could win.

The next competition was scheduled for Huntsville, Alabama. This time, the scenario was much larger: outdoor flying over longer distances. Everything about our drones needed to be scaled up significantly.

I made a difficult decision: I canceled my Erasmus plans to study in Barcelona for a semester. The exchange program could wait, but the drones couldn't. This competition was too important.

From September onwards, the preparation consumed nearly all my time. I spent countless hours in our team office, hunched over my computer designing the new quadcopters in Fusion 360. We named them RED and BULL—practical names that came from the limited colors of 3D printing filament we had available.

These new drones needed to be much bigger than anything we'd built before. Larger propellers would provide more lift to carry heavier payloads. Bigger batteries would enable longer flight times. More sensors would allow for accurate outdoor navigation. Every design decision seemed to cascade into dozens of others.

The design phase extended all the way through Easter. Then came the build phase, which was even more intense. I ran the 3D printers around the clock, day and night, producing parts continuously. RED came together first, passing its initial flight tests excellently. BULL followed shortly afterwards.

Then disaster struck during late-stage testing. Our supervisors provided us with larger batteries than we'd designed for. The heavier weight threw off our careful calculations, making both drones unstable. They crashed hard during testing.

I pulled multiple all-nighters to fix everything. More parts printed. More calibration adjustments. More test flights. By the time we packed our bags for Alabama, I was running purely on caffeine and stubbornness.

But finally, we were ready. As ready as we would ever be.
