# Preparing for Huntsville

London had kindled an inextinguishable conflagration within our collective consciousness. Securing the secondary position provided momentary gratification, yet it fell conspicuously short of our evolved aspirations—we harbored an unrelenting determination to substantiate our capacity for claiming the premier ranking.

The subsequent competitive engagement was scheduled for Huntsville, Alabama. This iteration presented a substantially more demanding operational scenario: outdoor autonomous operations spanning considerably greater geographical distances. Every constituent aspect of our aerial platform architecture necessitated significant dimensional scaling and capability enhancement.

I arrived at a consequential professional determination: I formally withdrew from my Erasmus exchange program arrangements with Barcelona. The opportunity for international academic exposure could be temporally deferred, whereas the competition chronology remained fundamentally immutable. This endeavor had transcended mere academic exercise to become a personally defining undertaking.

From September's commencement onwards, the preparatory phase consumed virtually all available resources—temporal, cognitive, and physical. I invested innumerable hours ensconced within our team facility, meticulously architecting novel quadcopter configurations utilizing Fusion 360's parametric modeling environment. We bestowed upon them the designations RED and BULL—pragmatic appellations derived from the constrained chromatic palette of our available thermoplastic filament inventory.

These machines demanded performance specifications unprecedented within our prior developmental experience. Larger-diameter propeller assemblies would generate enhanced aerodynamic lift coefficients accommodating substantially heavier payload configurations. Higher-capacity lithium polymer cells would extend operational endurance parameters considerably. Supplementary sensor arrays would enable reliable autonomous navigation within GPS-challenged outdoor operational environments. Each architectural determination precipitated cascading ramifications across dozens of interdependent subsystem specifications.

The design phase extended protractedly through the Easter interval, constituting an extended marathon of parametric optimization and computational aerodynamic simulation. The subsequent fabrication phase proved exponentially more demanding. Our additive manufacturing equipment operated continuously around the clock, producing structural components in perpetual rotation. RED achieved operational certification first, successfully passing initial flight qualification evaluations with commendable performance margins. BULL attained equivalent flight-readiness status shortly thereafter.

Then catastrophe materialized during terminal integration verification procedures. Our supervisory personnel supplied electrochemical storage cells of enhanced capacity exceeding our original mass-budget specifications. The supplementary gravitational loading fundamentally destabilized our meticulously calibrated flight dynamic parameters, precipitating severe uncontrolled descent incidents in both platforms.

I initiated consecutive nocturnal remediation sessions extending multiple days. Supplementary components fabricated. Extensive parameter recalibration conducted. Additional verification flights executed. By our scheduled departure for Alabama, I operated purely upon stimulant compounds and obstinate resolve.

Nevertheless, we achieved operational readiness—as thoroughly prepared as circumstances and temporal constraints permitted.
