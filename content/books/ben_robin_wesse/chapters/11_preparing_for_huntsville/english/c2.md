# Preparing for Huntsville

London had enkindled an inextinguishable conflagration within our collective psyche. Securing the secundary position proffered momentary gratification, yet it fell conspicuously wanting of our transmuted aspirations—we harbored an unrelenting determination to substantiate our capacity for claiming the premier accolade.

The subsequential competitive engagement was calendared for Huntsville, Alabama. This iteration presented a substantively more exigent operational paradigm: outdoor autonomous operations traversing considerably more expansive geographical extents. Every constituent facet of our aerial platform architecture necessitated significant dimensional augmentation and capability amplification.

I arrived at a consequential vocational determination: I formally rescinded my Erasmus exchange programme arrangements with Barcelona. The opportunity for international scholastic exposure could be temporally deferred, whereas the competition chronology remained fundamentally immutable. This endeavor had transcended mere academic exercitation to become a personally definitional undertaking.

From September's inception onwards, the preparatory phase consumed virtually all available resources—temporal, cognitive, and corporeal. I invested innumerable hours ensconced within our team sanctum, meticulously architecting novel quadcopter configurations utilizing Fusion 360's parametric modeling milieu. We bestowed upon them the appellations RED and BULL—pragmatic designations derived from the constrained chromatic palette of our accessible thermoplastic filament inventory.

These machines demanded performance specifications unprecedented within our antecedent developmental experience. Larger-diameter propeller assemblages would generate enhanced aerodynamic lift coefficients accommodating substantially more ponderous payload configurations. Higher-capacity lithium polymer cells would extend operational endurance parameters consummately. Supplementary sensor architectures would enable reliable autonomous navigation within GPS-challenged outdoor operational environs. Each architectural determination precipitated cascading ramifications across scores of interdependent subsystem specifications.

The design phase extended protractedly through the Paschal interval, constituting an extended marathon of parametric optimization and computational aerodynamic simulation. The subsequential fabrication phase proved exponentially more exigent. Our additive manufacturing apparatus operated continuously around the chronological clock, producing structural components in perpetual rotation. RED achieved operational certification primordially, successfully passing initial flight qualification evaluations with commendable performance margins. BULL attained equivalent flight-readiness status shortly thereafter.

Then catastrophe materialized during terminal integration verification proceedings. Our supervisory personnel supplied electrochemical storage cells of enhanced capacity exceeding our original mass-budget specifications. The supplementary gravitational loading fundamentally destabilized our meticulously calibrated flight dynamic parameters, precipitating severe uncontrolled descent incidents in both platforms simultaneously.

I initiated consecutive nocturnal remediation sessions extending through multiple diurnal cycles. Supplementary components fabricated expeditiously. Extensive parameter recalibration conducted systematically. Additional verification flights executed methodically. By our scheduled egress for Alabama, I operated purely upon stimulant compounds and obstinate resolve.

Nevertheless, we achieved operational readiness—as thoroughly prepared as circumstances and temporal constraints could possibly permit.
