# Preparing for Huntsville

London had ignited an unquenchable fire within us. Achieving second place was gratifying, but it fell short of our aspirations—we yearned to demonstrate that we could claim the top position.

The subsequent competition was calendared for Huntsville, Alabama. This iteration presented a substantially more demanding scenario: outdoor operations spanning considerably greater distances. Every aspect of our drone platform required significant scaling and enhancement.

I arrived at a consequential decision: I withdrew from my Erasmus exchange program in Barcelona. The opportunity to study abroad could be deferred, but the competition timeline was immutable. This endeavor had become too personally significant to compromise.

From September onwards, the preparation phase consumed virtually all available resources—temporal, mental, and physical. I invested innumerable hours ensconced in our team office, meticulously crafting the new quadcopter designs in Fusion 360. We christened them RED and BULL—pragmatic designations derived from the limited chromatic options of our 3D printing filament inventory.

These machines demanded specifications unprecedented in our previous constructions. Larger-diameter propellers would generate enhanced lift capacity for heavier payload requirements. Higher-capacity batteries would extend operational endurance substantially. Additional sensor arrays would enable reliable outdoor navigation in GPS-challenged environments. Each architectural decision precipitated cascading implications across dozens of interconnected subsystems.

The design phase extended protractedly through Easter, a marathon of parametric modeling and computational analysis. The subsequent build phase proved even more demanding. Our 3D printers operated continuously around the clock, producing structural components in perpetual rotation. RED achieved operational status first, passing initial flight evaluations with commendable margins. BULL reached flight-readiness shortly thereafter.

Then catastrophe materialized during late-stage integration testing. Our supervisory staff supplied batteries of greater capacity than our original specifications accommodated. The supplementary mass fundamentally destabilized our carefully calibrated flight dynamics, precipitating severe crashes in both platforms.

I initiated multiple consecutive all-night sessions to remediate the damage. Additional components printed. Extensive recalibration conducted. Supplementary test flights executed. By the departure date for Alabama, I operated purely on caffeine and obstinate determination.

Nevertheless, we achieved readiness—as prepared as circumstances permitted.
