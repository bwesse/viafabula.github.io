# Preparing for Huntsville

London made us want more. Second place was good, but we wanted first.

The next competition was in Huntsville, Alabama. The drones had to fly outside. They needed to fly longer distances.

I canceled my plans to study in Barcelona. The drones were more important.

I spent many hours in the office. I designed new drones in Fusion 360. We called them RED and BULL.

These drones were bigger. They had bigger propellers. They had bigger batteries. They had more sensors.

The design took until Easter. Then I started building. The 3D printers worked all day and night.

RED flew first. It worked well. Then BULL flew too.

But we had problems. The supervisors gave us heavier batteries. The drones crashed because of the extra weight.

I worked all night to fix them. I printed more parts. I did more tests.

When we left for Alabama, I was very tired. But we were ready.
