# Triumph in London

We boarded the flight to London carrying three drones that remained conspicuously unfinished and code that functioned marginally at best.

Blackbird, Goldeneye, Phoenix—our mechanical offspring, meticulously secured in custom-designed transport cases. Throughout the testing phase, we'd experienced multiple catastrophic crashes, witnessed component failures that defied explanation, and encountered software bugs that stubbornly resisted identification. By any rational assessment, we were woefully underprepared for international competition.

But rational assessment be damned—we went regardless.

The competition venue was a specialized facility in London, hosting teams from prestigious universities spanning Europe and America. These weren't enthusiastic amateurs—they represented well-funded research institutions with years, sometimes decades, of accumulated drone expertise. We, by comparison, were merely two students from Austria who had bootstrapped our entire knowledge base in less than twelve months.

The inaugural day unfolded as an absolute disaster. Setup complications cascaded into calibration nightmares. During practice runs, one of our drones crashed with sufficient violence to nearly annihilate itself entirely. Tim and I labored through the night in our cramped hotel room, soldering connections and debugging code while dawn broke over the city's skyline.

And then, unexpectedly, everything aligned.

Competition day arrived, and our drones performed magnificently. Not flawlessly, but with a competence that far exceeded our expectations—and apparently exceeded everyone else's as well. Teams that had invested years in development watched as our autonomous navigation executed perfectly, our search algorithms efficiently located targets, and our rescue protocols functioned precisely as designed.

We stared at the scoreboard in disbelief. We were systematically outperforming every other competitor.

Ultimately, we secured second place. City University of London, the host institution, claimed the top position. Rumors circulated regarding scoring irregularities that had proven suspiciously advantageous to the home team. Frankly, such concerns felt irrelevant. Achieving second place in our inaugural international competition, competing against teams possessing ten times our experience? That constituted an unequivocal victory.

Beyond the ranking, we had demonstrated something profound. Two former art students from Hamburg possessed the capacity to construct drones that genuinely challenged the world's best engineering programs. We could master virtually anything given sufficient commitment and dedication.

Flying homeward, exhausted yet euphoric, Tim and I reached a unanimous conclusion. Our journey wasn't concluding—it was merely beginning. The subsequent competition was scheduled for Huntsville, Alabama—and when that day arrived, we intended to claim first place.
