# Triumph in London

We departed for London transporting three unmanned aerial vehicles that remained conspicuously incomplete and software that functioned, charitably speaking, marginally.

Blackbird, Goldeneye, Phoenix—our mechanical progeny, meticulously secured within custom-fabricated transport enclosures. Throughout the antecedent testing phase, we had experienced multiple catastrophic incidents, witnessed inexplicable component malfunctions, and encountered software anomalies that obstinately resisted systematic identification. By any objective evaluation criterion, our preparedness for international competition remained demonstrably inadequate.

Nevertheless, prudent assessment notwithstanding, we proceeded regardless.

The competition venue comprised a specialized aerospace facility in London, aggregating teams representing distinguished universities distributed across Europe and North America. These constituted substantive research operations—well-capitalized institutions commanding years, occasionally decades, of accumulated expertise in autonomous systems development. Our credentials, by comparison, appeared decidedly modest: two students from an Austrian university who had bootstrapped their entire technical knowledge base in approximately eleven months.

The inaugural day materialized as an unmitigated catastrophe. Configuration complications cascaded into calibration malfunctions. During preliminary practice exercises, one of our platforms experienced a crash of sufficient magnitude to nearly precipitate total structural failure. Tim and I labored through the nocturnal hours in our cramped accommodations, executing hardware repairs and systematic debugging while dawn progressively illuminated the metropolitan skyline.

Then, with startling unexpectedness, synchronization emerged.

Competition day arrived, and our systems performed magnificently—not flawlessly, certainly, but with a competence that substantially exceeded our provisional expectations. Our autonomous navigation algorithms executed with precision. Our search heuristics efficiently identified designated targets. Our rescue protocols functioned precisely according to specification. Teams representing institutions with multiyear development programs observed with evident incredulity.

We contemplated the scoreboard with mounting disbelief. Our performance systematically exceeded that of every competing institution.

Ultimately, we secured second position. City University of London, functioning as host institution, claimed the premier ranking. Subsequent discourse included intimations regarding scoring methodologies that had proven suspiciously advantageous to the domestic competitor. Candidly, such considerations registered as inconsequential. Attaining second position in our inaugural international competition, contending against organizations possessing approximately ten times our accumulated experience? That outcome constituted an unequivocal triumph.

Beyond the formal ranking, we had substantiated something considerably more significant. Two individuals whose educational backgrounds centered on visual arts could engineer systems that legitimately challenged the preeminent aerospace programs globally. Mastery of virtually any domain remained achievable given sufficient commitment and systematic effort.

Returning homeward, simultaneously exhausted and exhilarated, Tim and I reached an unequivocal resolution. Our trajectory was ascending rather than concluding. The subsequent competition was scheduled for Huntsville, Alabama—and when that engagement materialized, we intended to secure the premier position.
