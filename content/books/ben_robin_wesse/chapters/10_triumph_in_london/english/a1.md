# Triumph in London

We flew to London with three drones. The drones were not finished. The code had problems.

Many teams were at the competition. They came from Europe and America. They had more experience than us.

The first day was bad. We had problems. One drone crashed during practice. Tim and I worked all night to fix it.

The next day was better. Our drones flew well. They did better than the other teams.

We got second place. The London team won first place. Some people said the London team got too many points because they were the hosts.

But we were happy. Second place was good for our first big competition. We learned that we could compete with the best teams.

On the plane home, Tim and I made a plan. The next competition was in Alabama. This time, we wanted to win.
