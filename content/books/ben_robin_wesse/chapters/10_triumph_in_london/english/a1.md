# Triumph in London

We flew to London with three drones that weren't finished and code that barely worked.

Blackbird, Goldeneye, Phoenix—our babies, packed carefully into cases that we'd designed ourselves. We'd had multiple crashes in testing. Components had failed. Code had bugs we couldn't identify. By any reasonable standard, we weren't ready.

But we went anyway.

The competition was held at a facility in London, with teams from universities across Europe and America. These weren't hobbyists—they were well-funded research groups with years of drone experience. We were two guys from Austria who'd learned everything in less than a year.

The first day was a disaster. Setup problems. Calibration issues. A crash during practice that nearly destroyed Goldeneye. Tim and I worked through the night, fixing hardware and debugging code in our hotel room while the sun came up over the city.

And then something clicked.

On competition day, our drones flew. Not perfectly, but well. Really well. Better than teams that had been working on this for years. Our autonomous navigation worked. Our search algorithms found the targets. Our rescue protocols executed correctly.

We couldn't believe the scoreboard. We were outperforming everyone.

In the end, we came second. The London team—City University, the hosts—took first place. There were whispers that the scoring had been... generous to the home team. But we didn't care. Second place, in our first international competition, against teams with ten times our experience? That was a victory.

More importantly, we'd proven something. Two art kids from Hamburg could build drones that competed with the best in the world. We could learn anything if we committed to it fully. We could achieve things that seemed impossible at the start.

Flying home, exhausted and elated, Tim and I made a decision. We weren't going to stop. The next competition was in Huntsville, Alabama—and this time, we were going to win.
