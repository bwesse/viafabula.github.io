# Triumph in London

We boarded the plane to London carrying three drones that weren't quite finished and code that had more bugs than we cared to admit.

Blackbird, Goldeneye, Phoenix—our creations, carefully packed in custom cases we had designed ourselves. During testing, we'd experienced multiple crashes, components had failed unexpectedly, and there were code problems we couldn't quite identify. By any reasonable measure, we weren't ready for an international competition.

But we went anyway, driven by determination and perhaps a bit of foolishness.

The competition took place at a specialized facility in London, with teams from prestigious universities across Europe and America. These weren't amateur hobbyists—they were well-funded research groups with years of experience in drone development. Meanwhile, we were just two students from Austria who had taught themselves everything in less than a year.

The first day proved disastrous. We encountered setup problems and calibration issues. During practice, one of our drones crashed and nearly destroyed itself completely. Tim and I worked through the entire night in our hotel room, repairing hardware and hunting for bugs while the sun rose over the city.

And then, somehow, everything clicked into place.

On competition day, our drones performed brilliantly. Not flawlessly, but surprisingly well—better than teams with many years of experience. Our autonomous navigation functioned correctly, our search algorithms located the targets efficiently, and our rescue procedures executed as designed.

Looking at the scoreboard, we could hardly believe our eyes. We were outperforming everyone in the competition.

In the end, we finished second. The London team from City University claimed first place. There were quiet suggestions that the scoring had been somewhat generous to the home team, but honestly, we didn't mind. Achieving second place in our first international competition, facing teams with ten times our experience? That was definitely a victory.

More importantly, we had proven something significant. Two former art students from Hamburg could build drones that competed against the best in the world. We could learn anything if we committed fully and worked hard enough.

Flying home, exhausted but thrilled, Tim and I made a firm decision. We weren't going to stop here. The next competition would be held in Huntsville, Alabama—and this time, we intended to win.
