# Triumph in London

So we flew to London with three drones that were basically held together with hope and duct tape. The code? Barely worked. We knew it.

Blackbird, Goldeneye, Phoenix—our babies, packed super carefully in cases we'd made ourselves. We'd crashed like a dozen times in testing. Stuff kept breaking. The code had bugs we couldn't even find. By any normal standard, we had no business being at this competition.

But whatever. We went anyway.

The competition was at this facility in London, and holy crap—teams from everywhere. Europe, America, big universities with actual funding and years of experience. Meanwhile, we're just two guys from Austria who learned everything in like a year. No pressure, right?

Day one was a complete disaster. Setup problems, calibration nightmares, and then we crashed during practice and almost totaled one of the drones. Tim and I stayed up literally all night in our hotel room, fixing hardware and hunting bugs while the sun came up. It was brutal.

And then... something just clicked.

Competition day hit, and our drones flew. Like, really flew. Way better than we expected. Better than teams who'd been doing this for years. The navigation worked, the search algorithms found everything, the rescue stuff executed perfectly. We kept looking at the scoreboard like "wait, that can't be right."

We were beating everyone.

Ended up getting second place. London's team won—City University, the hosts. People were whispering that the scoring was kind of sus, favoring the home team. But honestly? We didn't care. Second place in our first international thing, against teams with way more experience? That's a win in my book.

More than that, we proved something. Two art kids from Hamburg could actually build drones that competed with the best in the world. Pretty sick, honestly.

On the flight home, exhausted but pumped, Tim and I made a decision. We weren't stopping. Next up was Huntsville, Alabama—and this time, we were going to win.
