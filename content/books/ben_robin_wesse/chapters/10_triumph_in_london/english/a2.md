# Triumph in London

We flew to London with three drones that were not completely finished. The code still had some problems, and we were not sure if everything would work.

Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix—we had put them carefully in special cases that we designed ourselves. During testing, we had several crashes, and some parts had broken. By normal standards, we were not ready for the competition.

But we decided to go anyway.

The competition took place at a building in London. Teams from universities all over Europe and America were there. These teams had much more money and experience than us. They had been building drones for years. We had learned everything in less than a year.

The first day was a disaster. We had problems setting up the equipment. During practice, one of our drones crashed and almost broke completely. Tim and I worked through the whole night in our hotel room, fixing the hardware and finding problems in the code.

The next day, something changed. On competition day, our drones flew very well. They flew better than we expected. They performed better than teams with years of experience. Our navigation system worked correctly, and the drones found all the targets.

We could not believe what we saw on the scoreboard. We were doing better than everyone!

In the end, we got second place. The London team from City University won first place. Some people said the judges gave the London team too many points because they were the home team. But we did not care. Getting second place in our first international competition was amazing.

We had shown that two art students from Hamburg could build drones as good as the best teams in the world. On the flight home, Tim and I decided that we would not stop. The next competition was in Huntsville, Alabama—and this time, we wanted to win.
