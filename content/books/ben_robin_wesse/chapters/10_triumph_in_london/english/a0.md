# Triumph in London

We go to London. We have three drones.

The drones are not ready. But we go.

Many teams are there. They are very good.

Day one is bad. A drone crashes. We fix it at night.

Day two is good. Our drones fly well.

We get second place. The London team wins.

We are happy. Second place is good.

We want to win next time. Next time is in America.
