# The Mountain Mishap

The math exam was at 9 AM on a Tuesday. But Ben was not at the university. He was on the mountain.

Ben had confused the dates. He thought the exam was the following week. While Tim sat in the exam room, Ben was snowboarding in the mountains.

Tim called Ben when he got off the chairlift.

"Ben, where are you?"
"I'm on the mountain. Why do you ask?"
"The math exam started twenty minutes ago!"
Ben was silent. Then he said: "Oh no."

But the day got worse. On that same day, Ben fell while snowboarding. He fell badly and dislocated his shoulder. His arm was at a strange angle.

The ski patrol arrived first. Then a helicopter came. It was Ben's first helicopter ride. The Austrian healthcare system paid for everything.

At the hospital, the doctors put his shoulder back. Ben had time to think about his life. He missed the exam because he was snowboarding. He injured himself while snowboarding. Maybe this was a sign.

Ben could not snowboard for the rest of the season. His shoulder needed time to heal. So he started doing something new: hiking. He walked through the beautiful nature around Klagenfurt.

And he started studying seriously. When the retake exam arrived, Ben was prepared. He passed the exam. It was not a perfect result, but he passed.

Later, Tim and Ben laughed about what happened.
"You had to break yourself to finally take studying seriously," Tim said.
He was right.
