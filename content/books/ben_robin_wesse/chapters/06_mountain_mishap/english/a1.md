# The Mountain Mishap

Ben had a math exam on Tuesday.
But he made a mistake.
He thought the exam was next week.

On that Tuesday, Ben was snowboarding.
He was on the mountain.
Tim called him from the university.

"Ben, where are you?"
"I am on the mountain."
"The exam started twenty minutes ago!"
Ben was very shocked.

But that was not all.
The same day, Ben fell badly.
He hurt his shoulder very much.
His arm was in a wrong position.

The mountain rescue came.
They called a helicopter.
Ben flew to the hospital.
It was his first helicopter ride.

At the hospital, the doctors fixed his shoulder.
Ben thought about his life.
He missed the exam because of snowboarding.
He hurt himself because of snowboarding.

Ben could not snowboard anymore that season.
His shoulder needed time to heal.
So Ben started to walk and hike.
He discovered nature in a new way.

And he studied very hard.
When the second chance exam came, he was ready.
He passed the exam.

Tim laughed about it later.
"You had to hurt yourself to start studying!"
Ben agreed with him.
