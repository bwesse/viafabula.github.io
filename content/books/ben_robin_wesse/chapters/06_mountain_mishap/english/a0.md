# The Mountain Mishap

Ben has a math exam.
The exam is on Tuesday.
But Ben is on the mountain.

Ben is snowboarding.
He forgets the exam date.
Tim calls him.

"Where are you?"
"On the mountain."
"The exam is now!"

Ben is surprised.
He is very surprised.
He missed the exam!

Then Ben falls.
His shoulder hurts.
It hurts very much.

A helicopter comes.
Ben goes to the hospital.
The doctors help him.

Ben cannot snowboard now.
His shoulder needs rest.
He is sad but okay.

Ben thinks about his life.
He wants to study.
He wants to pass his exams.

Ben studies very hard.
He takes the exam again.
He passes the exam!

Tim laughs.
"You had to hurt yourself to study!"
Ben laughs too.
