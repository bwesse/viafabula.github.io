# The Mountain Mishap

The mathematics examination had been meticulously scheduled for nine o'clock on a Tuesday morning. I, regrettably, was not positioned within the confines of the designated examination venue—I was perched upon a mountainside.

Allow me to dispel any potential ambiguity: this was emphatically not a metaphorical mountain. I was quite literally secured to my snowboard, executing graceful descents through pristine, freshly deposited powder while Tim occupied his assigned seat within an examination hall, presumably constructing increasingly elaborate theories regarding my conspicuous absence.

The circumstances that precipitated this predicament unfolded as follows: I had managed to thoroughly confuse the examination dates. A quintessentially characteristic Ben maneuver, one might observe. Within the confines of my mental calendar, the examination was scheduled for the subsequent week. Tim initiated contact just as I was concluding my ascent via the chairlift.

"Might I inquire as to your present geographical location?"
"I find myself upon the mountain. Might I ask what prompts your inquiry?"
"The mathematics examination commenced approximately twenty minutes prior."
An extended silence permeated the connection. Eventually: "This is profoundly unfortunate."

The universe, it would appear, harbors a distinctly sardonic sense of humor. On that very same day, I sustained a dislocated shoulder. A single miscalculated landing, an ephemeral moment of excessive self-assurance, and I found myself sprawled across the alpine terrain, my arm configured at an anatomically inadvisable angle.

The ski patrol contingent materialized initially. Subsequently, the helicopter descended. My inaugural rotary-wing aviation experience—provided at no personal expense whatsoever, courtesy of the comprehensive Austrian healthcare infrastructure and my own profound lapses in judgment.

Within the clinical confines of the hospital, as the medical professionals manipulated my shoulder back into its appropriate articulation, I was afforded substantial opportunity for contemplative reflection. I had forfeited my examination opportunity due to snowboarding pursuits. I had sustained physical injury during those same snowboarding pursuits. Perhaps the cosmos was attempting to communicate some fundamental truth regarding my priorities.

Yet herein lies the illuminating dimension of adversity: it possesses the capacity to catalyze extraordinary clarity. Recumbent upon that hospital bed, I arrived at a revelation of considerable personal significance—I genuinely invested emotional capital in achieving success. I harbored authentic desires to excel within this academic program—not in spite of its formidable difficulty, but precisely because of its demanding nature. The struggle itself constituted meaning.

Snowboarding would necessarily remain inaccessible for the duration of the season. My shoulder demanded an extended recuperation period. Consequently, I embarked upon an unanticipated alternative: ambulatory exploration. Hiking through alpine terrain. Discovering the natural splendor encircling Klagenfurt through pedestrian rather than board-mounted means.

And I devoted myself to academic preparation. Genuine, substantive preparation. When the retake examination materialized, my readiness was comprehensive. I achieved a passing result. Not distinguished, certainly, but definitively passing.

Tim and I subsequently shared considerable amusement regarding the entire episode. "You quite literally needed to sustain physical trauma before approaching this undertaking with appropriate gravity," he observed.

His assessment demonstrated considerable accuracy.
