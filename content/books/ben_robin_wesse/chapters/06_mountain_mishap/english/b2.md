# The Mountain Mishap

The mathematics examination had been scheduled for 9 AM on a Tuesday morning. I, however, was not seated in the examination hall—I was positioned on a mountainside.

To be absolutely clear, this was not a metaphorical mountain. I was quite literally strapped to my snowboard, carving elegant arcs through freshly fallen powder while Tim occupied a seat in an examination room, presumably wondering where on earth I could possibly be.

Here's how the situation unfolded: I had managed to confuse the dates entirely. A quintessentially Ben maneuver, if there ever was one. In my mind, the exam was scheduled for the following week. Tim contacted me just as I was disembarking from the chairlift.

"Where exactly are you right now?"
"I'm up on the mountain. Why do you ask?"
"The mathematics exam commenced twenty minutes ago."
A prolonged silence ensued. Finally: "Oh no."

The universe, it seems, possesses a peculiar sense of humor. On that very same day, I suffered a dislocated shoulder. One miscalculated landing, a single moment of excessive confidence, and I suddenly found myself sprawled in the snow, my arm positioned at an angle that arms are decidedly not meant to assume.

The ski patrol team arrived first. Subsequently, the helicopter arrived. My inaugural helicopter journey—provided entirely free of charge, courtesy of the Austrian healthcare system and my own profound foolishness.

In the hospital, as the medical staff repositioned my shoulder, I was afforded ample time for introspection. I had missed the examination because I was snowboarding. I had injured myself while snowboarding. Perhaps the universe was attempting to communicate something significant to me.

Yet here's what I came to understand about setbacks: they possess the capacity to bring clarity. Lying in that hospital bed, I came to the realization that I genuinely cared about succeeding. I wanted to excel in this program—not in spite of its difficulty, but precisely because of its difficulty. The struggle carried genuine meaning.

Snowboarding was no longer an option for the remainder of the season. My shoulder required time to recuperate. So I did something unanticipated: I began walking. Hiking through the terrain. Exploring the natural environment surrounding Klagenfurt on foot rather than on a board.

And I studied. I studied with genuine dedication. When the retake examination arrived, I was thoroughly prepared. I passed. Not with distinction, but I passed nonetheless.

Tim and I shared a laugh about the entire ordeal afterward. "You literally had to sustain an injury before you started taking this endeavor seriously," he remarked.

He was not incorrect in that assessment.
