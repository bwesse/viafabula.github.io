# The Mountain Mishap

The math exam was scheduled for 9 AM on a Tuesday. I was on a mountain.

Not metaphorically on a mountain—literally on a mountain, strapped to my snowboard, carving through fresh powder while Tim sat in an exam hall wondering where the hell I was.

Here's what happened: I got my dates mixed up. Classic Ben move. I thought the exam was next week. Tim called me as I was getting off the chairlift.

"Dude, where are you?"
"On the mountain. Why?"
"The math exam started twenty minutes ago."
Silence. Then: "Oh no."

But the universe has a sense of humor. That same day, I dislocated my shoulder. One wrong landing, one moment of overconfidence, and suddenly I was lying in the snow, my arm at an angle arms shouldn't be at.

The ski patrol came. Then the helicopter came. My first helicopter ride—free of charge, courtesy of the Austrian healthcare system and my own stupidity.

In the hospital, as they popped my shoulder back in place, I had time to reflect. I'd missed the exam because I was snowboarding. I'd injured myself snowboarding. Maybe the universe was trying to tell me something.

But here's the thing about setbacks: they can clarify things. Lying in that hospital bed, I realized I actually cared about passing. I wanted to succeed in this program—not despite it being hard, but because it was hard. The struggle meant something.

I couldn't snowboard for the rest of the season. My shoulder needed time. So I did something unexpected: I started walking. Hiking. Exploring the nature around Klagenfurt on foot instead of on a board.

And I studied. Really studied. When the retake exam came around, I was ready. I passed. Not brilliantly, but I passed.

Tim and I laughed about it later. "You literally had to break yourself to start taking this seriously," he said.

He wasn't wrong.
