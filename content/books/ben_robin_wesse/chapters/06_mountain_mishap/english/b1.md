# The Mountain Mishap

The math exam was scheduled for 9 AM on a Tuesday. I was not in the exam room—I was on a mountain.

I'm not speaking metaphorically here. I was literally on a mountain, attached to my snowboard, riding through fresh snow while Tim was sitting in an exam hall wondering where I was.

Here's what happened: I got the dates confused. It was a typical Ben mistake. I was sure the exam was next week. Tim called me as I was getting off the chairlift.

"Hey, where are you?"
"I'm on the mountain. Why?"
"The math exam started twenty minutes ago."
There was silence. Then I said: "Oh no."

But the universe seems to have a sense of humor. On that same day, I fell badly and dislocated my shoulder. One wrong landing, one moment of too much confidence, and suddenly I was lying in the snow with my arm at an angle that arms should not be at.

The ski patrol arrived first. Then the helicopter came. My first helicopter ride—completely free, thanks to the Austrian healthcare system and my own stupidity.

At the hospital, while the doctors fixed my shoulder, I had time to think about things. I had missed the exam because I was snowboarding. I had injured myself while snowboarding. Maybe the universe was trying to tell me something important.

But here's what I learned about problems: they can make things clearer. Lying in that hospital bed, I realized I actually cared about succeeding. I wanted to pass this program—not although it was difficult, but because it was difficult. The struggle had meaning.

I couldn't snowboard for the rest of the season. My shoulder needed time to heal. So I did something unexpected: I started walking instead. Hiking. I explored the nature around Klagenfurt on foot rather than on a board.

And I studied. I really studied this time. When the second chance exam came, I was prepared. I passed. Not perfectly, but I passed.

Tim and I laughed about everything later. "You literally had to injure yourself to start taking this seriously," he said.

He wasn't wrong about that.
