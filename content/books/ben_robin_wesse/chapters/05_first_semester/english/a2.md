# First Semester

Ben arrived in Klagenfurt carrying only a backpack and his snowboard. He had no idea what was waiting for him.

Back in Hamburg, Ben had always been the art student. He finished high school with a focus on art—painting, drawing, and creative projects. He had never touched robots or studied technical subjects before. The idea of learning robotics was exciting but also scary.

His plan was very practical: "If this program doesn't work for me, at least I'll enjoy snowboarding. Then I can try something else." He had low expectations but high hopes.

The first week of university hit him hard. He had lectures in linear algebra, physics, and basic programming. Everyone around him seemed to understand everything immediately. Ben sat there thinking, "What have I gotten myself into?"

But Ben refused to quit. He attended every lecture and every tutorial session. He took notes even when he didn't understand them. Every night, he went home and watched YouTube videos to learn the material. The theory was dry and boring, but he was determined to succeed.

Then something unexpected happened. He passed his first exam! And then another one. The material started to make sense—not because Ben was suddenly a genius, but because he never stopped trying.

Meanwhile, the mountains were calling to him. Every weekend when the weather was good, he went snowboarding. The slopes became his therapy—his reward for surviving another week of difficult studies. He discovered that his best ideas came to him while sitting on the chairlift, when his mind finally had space to think.

During those first weeks, Ben met Tim—another German student, also from Hamburg! It seemed like a strange coincidence. They had grown up in the same city but had to travel to Austria to become friends. Tim was in the same program, struggling with the same material. Soon they were studying together, complaining together, and eventually succeeding together.

By the end of the first semester, Ben had proven something important to himself. He wasn't naturally talented at technical subjects, but he could learn. He could adapt. He could use his artistic eye to understand systems, patterns, and movements in a different way.

The mountains had accepted him. The university had accepted him. Maybe now he could accept himself.
