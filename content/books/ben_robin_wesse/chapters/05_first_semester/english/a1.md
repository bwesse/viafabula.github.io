# First Semester

Ben arrived in Klagenfurt with his backpack and snowboard.
He did not know what to expect.

In Hamburg, Ben studied art.
He painted pictures and made drawings.
He never studied robots or machines.
Now he wanted to try something new.

His plan was simple.
"If I don't like it, I can leave," he thought.
"At least I can snowboard in the mountains."

The first week was very difficult.
He had classes in math, physics, and programming.
The other students understood quickly.
Ben felt lost and confused.

But Ben did not give up.
He went to every class.
He studied every night.
He watched videos on YouTube to understand.
The work was boring, but he kept trying.

Then something good happened.
He passed his first exam!
He passed more exams too.
Ben started to understand the material.

Ben also met a new friend named Tim.
Tim was from Hamburg too!
They studied together.
They helped each other.

Every weekend, Ben went to the mountains.
He went snowboarding.
The mountains made him happy.
They helped him relax after studying.

At the end of the semester, Ben felt proud.
He was not the best student.
But he worked hard and learned a lot.
He could do this.
