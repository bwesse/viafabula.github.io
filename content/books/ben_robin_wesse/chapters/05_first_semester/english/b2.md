# First Semester

I arrived in Klagenfurt equipped with nothing more than a well-worn backpack, a beloved snowboard, and a profound uncertainty about what lay ahead.

Robotics and artificial intelligence? I had never so much as glanced at a circuit board in my entire life. Back in Hamburg, I had been firmly established as the artistic type. I had completed my Abitur with a specialization in visual arts—painting, sketching, and various creative endeavors that bore absolutely no resemblance to the technical curriculum I was about to undertake. The prospect of immersing myself in a world of equations, algorithms, and electronic circuits was, quite frankly, intimidating. Yet something about the field captivated my imagination—the notion of bringing inanimate objects to life, of creating machines capable of perceiving and responding to their environment.

My strategy was deliberately pragmatic: should the academic venture prove unsuccessful, I would at least have spent several seasons mastering the spectacular Alpine slopes. The worst-case scenario still seemed rather appealing. Low expectations, high hopes—this became my unofficial motto.

The initial week of lectures struck me with the force of an avalanche. Linear algebra, classical physics, fundamental programming concepts—the barrage of new information was relentless. My fellow students appeared to absorb these concepts effortlessly, while I found myself questioning the wisdom of my decision at every turn.

Nevertheless, I persisted. I attended every scheduled lecture and participated in every tutorial session. I scribbled notes that I could scarcely comprehend at the time, then retreated to my apartment to spend countless hours watching explanatory videos online. The theoretical foundations were undeniably arid—mathematics divorced from any tangible application—but my determination to succeed remained unshaken.

Then something remarkable occurred. I passed my first examination. Then another. Gradually, incrementally, the abstract concepts began crystallizing into coherent understanding. This transformation happened not because I had suddenly developed extraordinary aptitude, but simply because I categorically refused to surrender.

Throughout this academic struggle, the mountains served as my constant sanctuary. Whenever weather conditions permitted, I would escape to the slopes. Snowboarding evolved into my personal therapy, my reward for enduring another grueling week of abstract theories. I made an interesting discovery during those solitary chairlift rides—with my body occupied and my mind freed from active problem-solving, my best insights would spontaneously emerge.

Tim entered my life during those formative early weeks—a fellow German, and astonishingly, another native of Hamburg. The statistical improbability of this coincidence seemed almost absurd. We had grown up in the same metropolitan area yet required a journey to the Austrian Alps to forge our friendship. He faced identical academic challenges in the same demanding program, and before long we had established a routine of studying together, commiserating together, and ultimately celebrating our successes together.

As the first semester drew to its conclusion, I had demonstrated something significant—primarily to myself. I possessed no innate talent for technical disciplines, but I had proven my capacity for growth and adaptation. Perhaps most surprisingly, I discovered that my artistic sensibilities—my trained eye for pattern, form, and movement—could be repurposed as analytical tools for understanding complex systems.

The mountains had welcomed me into their domain. The university had granted me passage into its academic world. Perhaps it was finally time to extend that same acceptance to myself.
