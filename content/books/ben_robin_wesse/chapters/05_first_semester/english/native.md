# First Semester

I showed up in Klagenfurt with a backpack, a snowboard, and absolutely no clue what I was doing.

Robotics? I'd never touched a robot in my life. Back in Hamburg, I was the art kid. I did my Abitur in art—painting, drawing, creative stuff. The idea of studying something with equations and circuits was honestly terrifying. But something about it called to me: the idea of creating things that moved, that responded to the world.

My plan was simple: if this doesn't work out, at least I'll have had a great time snowboarding. Then I'll figure something else out. Low expectations, high hopes.

The first week of lectures hit me like a truck. Linear algebra. Physics. Programming basics. Everyone around me seemed to get it instantly. I sat there thinking, "What have I done?"

But I kept showing up. Every lecture, every tutorial. I took notes I barely understood, then went home and watched YouTube explanations until two in the morning. The theory was dry—painfully dry—but I was determined not to fail.

And then something unexpected happened. I passed my first exam. Then another. The material started making sense—not because I was suddenly brilliant, but because I refused to give up.

Meanwhile, the mountains were calling. Every weekend that weather permitted, I was up there. The slopes became my therapy, my reward for surviving another week of equations. I discovered that the best ideas came to me on the chairlift, when my brain finally had space to process everything.

I met Tim during those early weeks—a fellow German, also from Hamburg, which felt like a cosmic joke. We'd grown up in the same city but had to travel to Austria to become friends. He was in the same program, struggling with the same material, and soon we were studying together, complaining together, and eventually succeeding together.

By the end of the first semester, I had proven something to myself. I wasn't naturally gifted at this stuff, but I could learn. I could adapt. I could take my artist's eye and apply it to understanding systems, patterns, movements.

The mountains had accepted me. The university had accepted me. Maybe I could accept myself.
