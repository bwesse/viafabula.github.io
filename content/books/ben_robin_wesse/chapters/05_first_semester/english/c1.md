# First Semester

I materialized in Klagenfurt bearing the meager possessions of a deliberate nomad: a weathered backpack containing my worldly essentials and a snowboard that had accompanied me across three continents. Beyond these tangible items, I possessed nothing but a profound and somewhat exhilarating uncertainty about the path I had chosen.

Robotics and artificial intelligence? The very terminology felt foreign on my tongue. I had never engaged with technology in any meaningful capacity throughout my formative years in Hamburg. There, I had cultivated an identity firmly rooted in artistic expression—I had completed my Abitur with a concentration in visual arts, spending my final school years immersed in painting, drawing, and the kind of creative exploration that exists at the furthest possible remove from the world of circuit boards and algorithmic thinking. The prospect of reinventing myself as a student of engineering and computer science was, to employ perhaps insufficient understatement, intimidating. Yet beneath that trepidation lay an irresistible fascination—the tantalizing possibility of creating entities that could move, perceive, and respond to their environment with something approaching autonomous intelligence.

I had devised what I considered an ingeniously pragmatic contingency plan: if the academic endeavor proved incompatible with my capabilities, I would at minimum have invested several seasons perfecting my snowboarding technique on some of Europe's most spectacular alpine terrain. Even the worst-case scenario possessed considerable appeal. Low expectations, high aspirations—this became the philosophical framework that would sustain me through the challenges ahead.

The inaugural week of lectures descended upon me with overwhelming force. Linear algebra, classical mechanics, fundamental programming paradigms—each discipline presented itself as an impenetrable fortress of abstraction. My fellow students, many of whom had presumably been tinkering with technology since childhood, appeared to internalize these concepts with frustrating ease. I sat among them experiencing mounting doubt about the wisdom of my impulsive decision.

Nevertheless, capitulation was never a genuine consideration. I maintained perfect attendance at every scheduled lecture and participated diligently in every tutorial session. I accumulated notebooks filled with annotations that remained largely incomprehensible upon initial transcription, then dedicated my evenings to exhaustive online research, seeking alternative explanations that might bridge the gap between my artistic intuition and these mathematical abstractions. The foundational theory was undeniably arid—mathematics presented without context or application—but my resolution to succeed remained absolute.

Then, improbably, breakthrough arrived. I passed my first examination. Subsequently, another. The previously opaque material commenced a gradual transformation into comprehensible patterns. This metamorphosis occurred not through any sudden manifestation of latent genius, but through sheer persistence—the stubborn refusal to acknowledge defeat as a viable outcome.

Throughout this period of intensive academic struggle, the mountains served as my psychological sanctuary. Whenever meteorological conditions permitted, I would escape to the slopes above Klagenfurt. Snowboarding evolved from recreational pursuit to essential therapy—my compensation for surviving another week of intellectual strain. A curious phenomenon emerged during those solitary ascents: suspended on the chairlift between runs, my mind freed from active problem-solving, I would experience moments of unexpected clarity. Solutions to programming challenges would materialize unbidden; abstract mathematical concepts would suddenly reveal their underlying logic.

Tim entered my life during those transformative early weeks—a fellow German who, through some cosmic jest, happened to share my hometown of Hamburg. The statistical improbability of this coincidence bordered on the absurd: we had spent our formative years in the same metropolitan area, perhaps even passing each other unknowingly on Mönckebergstraße, only to forge our friendship two countries removed from our origins. He was enrolled in the identical program, confronting the identical material with comparable trepidation, and we rapidly established a symbiotic relationship—studying in tandem, commiserating over shared frustrations, and ultimately celebrating our incremental victories together.

As the semester approached its conclusion, I had accomplished something of profound personal significance. I had demonstrated, primarily to my own persistent inner skeptic, that innate aptitude was not a prerequisite for achievement. I could learn; I could adapt; I could evolve. Perhaps most remarkably, I discovered that my years of artistic training—my cultivated sensitivity to pattern, form, movement, and spatial relationships—provided unexpected advantages in visualizing and comprehending complex systems.

The mountains had extended their welcome. The university had granted me provisional membership in its intellectual community. Perhaps, at last, I could extend that same acceptance to myself.
