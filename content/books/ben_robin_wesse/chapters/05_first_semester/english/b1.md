# First Semester

I showed up in Klagenfurt with nothing but a backpack, a snowboard, and absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into.

Robotics? I'd never touched a robot in my life. Back in Hamburg, I was known as the art kid. I completed my Abitur specializing in art—painting, drawing, all kinds of creative work. The thought of studying something involving equations, circuits, and programming was honestly terrifying. But there was something about it that attracted me—the idea of creating things that could move and respond to the world around them.

My approach was fairly simple: if this doesn't work out, at least I'll have enjoyed some great snowboarding. Then I'll figure out what to do next. I had low expectations but high hopes for the adventure ahead.

The first week of lectures was overwhelming. Linear algebra, physics, programming fundamentals—it all came at me at once. Everyone around me seemed to grasp the concepts immediately, while I sat there wondering what on earth I had done.

But I refused to give up. I showed up for every lecture and every tutorial session. I took notes that I barely understood, then went home and watched YouTube explanations until two in the morning. The theoretical material was painfully dry, but I was absolutely determined not to fail.

And then something unexpected happened. I passed my first exam. Then I passed another one. The material gradually started making sense—not because I had suddenly become brilliant, but because I simply refused to give up.

Meanwhile, the mountains were constantly calling me. Every weekend when the weather cooperated, I headed up to the slopes. Snowboarding became my therapy, my reward for surviving another week of challenging equations. I discovered that my best ideas often came to me while riding the chairlift, when my brain finally had the space to process everything I'd been learning.

I met Tim during those early weeks—a fellow German who was also from Hamburg, which felt like some kind of cosmic joke. We had grown up in the same city but had to travel all the way to Austria to become friends. He was enrolled in the same program, struggling with the same material, and before long we were studying together, complaining together, and eventually succeeding together.

By the end of that first semester, I had proved something important to myself. I wasn't naturally gifted at technical subjects, but I could learn. I could adapt. I could take my artistic perspective and apply it to understanding systems, patterns, and movements in ways that surprised even me.

The mountains had accepted me. The university had accepted me. Perhaps it was time to accept myself.
