# Prologue

Meet Ben Robin Wesse, a 22-year-old German from the vibrant city of Hamburg. His story is one of adventure, uncertainty, and unexpected discoveries.

Ben was never the type to follow a straight path. During high school, he spent a year in Canada as an exchange student. After graduation, he traveled through Peru in South America. He was searching for something, but he wasn't exactly sure what.

Ben had always been fascinated by robots and things that move. He loved creating new gadgets and devices. But when it came to choosing a career and a place to study, he felt lost. He wanted more than just a good university—he wanted a beautiful place to live.

That's how Ben found Klagenfurt, a charming town in Austria near the Italian border. With its stunning lake and nearby mountains perfect for snowboarding, it seemed like the ideal place. Ben enrolled in the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence program at the university there.

What started as an uncertain experiment became something remarkable. Ben passed his exams, built drones for an international competition, and won against teams from around the world. Along the way, he found friendship, adventure, and his true passion.

Now Ben lives in Barcelona, pursuing his master's degree and continuing his journey. This is the story of how he got there—a tale of dreams, drones, and discovering where you belong.
