# Prologue

The journey of Ben Robin Wesse is not a typical coming-of-age story. It's a tale woven from uncertainty, adventure, and the unexpected turns that shape our lives.

Born and raised in Hamburg, Germany, Ben grew up in one of Europe's most dynamic port cities. Yet from an early age, he felt the pull of distant horizons. During his high school years, he crossed the Atlantic for an exchange year in Canada, an experience that would plant seeds of wanderlust in his heart.

After completing his Abitur, Ben didn't rush into university like many of his peers. Instead, he packed his backpack and headed to South America, spending months exploring Peru's ancient ruins and diverse landscapes. It was during this time of reflection that he began searching for his next chapter—both literally and figuratively.

Ben had always been drawn to robotics and engineering. He loved building things that moved, creating machines that could interact with the world. But choosing where to study proved challenging. He didn't just want academic excellence; he wanted a place worth living in.

His search led him to Klagenfurt, Austria—a picturesque town nestled between alpine peaks and a crystal-clear lake, just a stone's throw from Italy. Here, the Alpen-Adria University offered a program in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence that caught his attention. Combined with world-class snowboarding nearby, it seemed almost too perfect.

What followed were years of transformation. Ben went from uncertain student to competition-winning drone engineer. He built aircraft, wrote code, crashed spectacularly, and rebuilt even better. He traveled across continents, made lifelong friends, and discovered that sometimes the best path is the one you create yourself.

This book chronicles Ben's remarkable journey from Hamburg to Barcelona, where he now pursues his master's degree. It's a story about following your instincts, embracing uncertainty, and finding your place in the world.
