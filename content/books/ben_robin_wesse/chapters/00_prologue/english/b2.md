# Prologue

Some stories begin with certainty—a clear goal, a defined path, a predetermined destination. The story of Ben Robin Wesse is not one of those stories. It's a narrative born from wanderlust, shaped by serendipity, and defined by the courage to embrace the unknown.

At twenty-two years old, Ben has already accumulated more stamps in his passport than most people twice his age. From the bustling streets of Hamburg where he grew up, to the vast Canadian wilderness where he spent an exchange year, to the mystical highlands of Peru where he found himself searching for direction—his journey has been anything but conventional.

Ben never fit the mold of the traditional student. While his peers meticulously planned their careers, he was more interested in how things worked, how machines moved, how robots could be built to interact with the world around them. This fascination with creation and movement would eventually lead him to robotics, but the path there was far from straight.

The turning point came in an unlikely place: Klagenfurt, Austria. This small city, nestled between the Julian Alps and the pristine Wörthersee lake, offered everything Ben hadn't realized he was looking for. A world-class university with a cutting-edge robotics program. Mountains that called to his snowboarder's soul. Proximity to Italy for spontaneous adventures. And perhaps most importantly, a community where an uncertain young man could discover his potential.

In Klagenfurt, Ben found more than education. He found purpose. Working on the SAPIENCE drone project with his friend Tim, another Hamburg native, Ben transformed from a student who questioned his abilities into an engineer whose creations could win international competitions. He learned to code under pressure, to rebuild after catastrophic crashes, and to believe in his capacity to solve problems others deemed unsolvable.

This book tells that story—the full, unfiltered journey from a confused teenager in Hamburg to a confident engineer in Barcelona. It's about the gap years that weren't wasted, the failures that became lessons, the friends who became family, and the dreams that evolved into reality.

Welcome to Ben's world. May his story inspire you to forge your own unconventional path.
