# Prologue

Everyone tells you to figure out your life by the time you're eighteen. Pick a major. Choose a career. Know exactly where you'll be in five years. What a load of rubbish.

This is the story of Ben Robin Wesse, and if there's one thing you'll learn from it, it's that the best journeys are the ones you don't plan.

Ben grew up in Hamburg—you know, that big German city with the harbor and the fish sandwiches and the rain that never seems to quit. He was a pretty normal kid, except for one thing: he couldn't stop taking things apart. Robots, gadgets, anything with moving parts. He'd disassemble them, figure out how they worked, and sometimes even put them back together.

High school was... well, it was high school. But then came Canada. A year abroad, living with a host family, pretending to understand hockey, and realizing that the world was way bigger than Hamburg's city limits.

After graduation, most of his friends headed straight to university. Ben? He headed to Peru. Spent months backpacking through the Andes, eating ceviche, learning Spanish from locals, and asking himself the big questions: What the hell am I supposed to do with my life? Where should I live? What actually makes me happy?

He found the answers in the most unlikely place: a small Austrian town called Klagenfurt. Lakes, mountains, incredible skiing, and—bonus—a university with a robotics program. It was like someone had designed a city specifically for Ben.

What happened next was the kind of stuff that doesn't feel real when you're living it. Ben joined a drone project, built actual flying robots, competed internationally, crashed spectacularly, rebuilt everything, won against all odds, traveled the world, wrote a thesis in the Colombian jungle, and eventually landed in Barcelona for grad school.

This book is that story. It's messy and weird and doesn't follow any logical order, just like life itself. Ben hopes it'll inspire you to stop worrying about having everything figured out and start embracing the chaos.

Buckle up. It's going to be a wild ride.
