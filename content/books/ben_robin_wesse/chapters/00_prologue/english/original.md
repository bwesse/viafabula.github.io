# Prologue

You know what's funny? I never planned any of this.

I'm Ben. Ben Robin Wesse. Twenty-two years old as I write this, sitting in my Barcelona apartment with the sound of Spanish floating up from the street below. A few years ago, I was a confused kid from Hamburg who had no idea what to do with his life. Now I'm here, studying for a master's degree in automation and robotics, having won an international drone competition in Alabama of all places.

Life is weird like that.

This book is my attempt to make sense of the journey. Not because I think I've got it all figured out—I definitely don't—but because maybe my story can help someone else who's feeling just as lost as I was.

It started in Hamburg, the city of rain and harbors and really good kebabs. I spent my childhood there, went to school there, and spent way too much time wondering what I was supposed to become. The exchange year in Canada during high school showed me that the world was bigger than I thought. The months in Peru after graduation showed me that I didn't have to follow anyone else's timeline.

And Klagenfurt? Klagenfurt showed me that sometimes the right place finds you.

I found a university with a robotics program in a town surrounded by mountains and lakes. Perfect for snowboarding. Perfect for figuring stuff out. I went in thinking "if this doesn't work, at least I'll have had fun." Then I passed my exams. Then I joined a drone project. Then we built actual search and rescue robots and flew to London and Alabama to compete against teams from around the world.

We won, by the way. Still feels unreal.

Along the way, I made incredible friends, crashed countless drones (and myself, once—hello, helicopter ride to the hospital), explored countries I'd never imagined visiting, and somehow managed to write a bachelor's thesis from various hostels in Colombia.

This is that story. All of it. The good parts, the disasters, the moments where I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I hope it's entertaining. I hope it's useful. And I really hope it convinces you that not knowing what you want is totally fine.

Because honestly? The not-knowing is where all the good stuff happens.

Let's begin.
