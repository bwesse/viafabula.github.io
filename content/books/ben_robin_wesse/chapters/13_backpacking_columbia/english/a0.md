# Backpacking Colombia

We won the competition. We were happy.

Tim and I go to Colombia. We travel for one month.

Colombia is beautiful. We see mountains and beaches.

We also write our theses. We write in hostels and cafes.

It is hard work. But we are happy.

One month later, we finish. We send our theses.

Tim goes to Europe. I go to Barcelona.

A new adventure begins.
