# Backpacking Colombia

We had just won the biggest competition of our lives. The reasonable thing to do would have been to go home and celebrate.

Instead, Tim and I flew to Colombia for a month of backpacking.

We deserved this vacation. We really needed it. After years of drone parts, all-nighters, and stress, we needed to just exist for a while.

There was only one problem: We still had our bachelor's theses to write.

So there we were, in jungle hostels and mountain towns, our laptops glowing in hammocks and cheap hotel rooms. By day, we explored—Cartagena's beautiful colonial streets, the coffee country's green hills, and Medellín's amazing transformation. By night, we typed our theses.

It was quite absurd, actually. We were writing academic papers about drone systems while monkeys screamed in the trees outside. Sweat dripped onto our keyboards in the tropical heat. But somehow, it worked.

The month passed in a blur of buses, beaches, and bibliography citations. When we finally submitted our theses from an internet café somewhere in Colombia, the relief was physical. Years of work—the studying, the building, the competing, the writing—all of it was finally done.

Tim headed back to Europe. I headed to Barcelona. Different flights, different destinations, but the same strong friendship that we had built together.

The next chapter was about to begin.
