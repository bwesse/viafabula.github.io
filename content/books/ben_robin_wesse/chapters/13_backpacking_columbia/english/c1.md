# Backpacking Colombia

We had just secured victory in the most significant competition of our academic careers. The prudent course of action would have been to return home and celebrate this considerable achievement with family and colleagues.

Instead, Tim and I booked flights to Colombia for an extended sojourn through South America.

We unequivocally merited this respite. We desperately required it. After years immersed in drone components, sleepless nights devoted to coding and construction, and the relentless psychological pressure of competition, we needed to simply exist for a period—to inhabit the roles of travelers rather than engineers, adventurers rather than competitors.

There existed, however, a singular complication: our bachelor's theses remained incomplete.

Thus we found ourselves ensconced in jungle hostels and mountain settlements, laptop screens luminescent in hammocks and modest accommodations. During daylight hours, we explored with abandon—meandering through Cartagena's evocative colonial thoroughfares, traversing the coffee region's verdant hillsides, contemplating Medellín's remarkable metamorphosis from its notorious history to contemporary vibrancy. After sunset, we typed with considerable urgency.

The juxtaposition was patently absurd. Composing rigorous academic treatises on autonomous drone systems whilst simians vocalized cacophonously in the arboreal surroundings. Perspiration cascading onto keyboards in the equatorial humidity. Yet somehow, improbably, the disparate elements coalesced into coherent submissions.

The month dissipated in a kaleidoscope of overnight buses, Caribbean littorals, and bibliographic citations. When we finally executed the submission from a cramped internet establishment somewhere in Colombia's interior, the relief manifested almost corporeally. Years of accumulated endeavor—the academic study, the mechanical construction, the competitive striving, the interminable composition—all of it conclusively terminated.

Tim embarked upon his return to Europe to commence his subsequent chapter. I proceeded to Barcelona to inaugurate mine. Divergent trajectories, disparate destinations, yet the same adamantine friendship forged through shared adversity.

The succeeding adventure awaited commencement.
