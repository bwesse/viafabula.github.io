# Backpacking Colombia

We had just secured triumph in the most consequential competition of our academic odyssey. The circumspect course of action would have been to return to our respective domiciles and commemorate this considerable achievement amidst familial and collegial company.

In contradistinction, Tim and I procured passage to Colombia for an extended peregrination through the South American continent.

We unequivocally merited this respite from our labors. We desperately necessitated it. After years of immersion in the minutiae of drone componentry, sleepless nights consecrated to algorithmic development and mechanical construction, and the unrelenting psychological duress of competitive endeavor, we required a hiatus—to inhabit the personae of wanderers rather than engineers, peripatetic adventurers rather than driven competitors.

There persisted, however, a singular complication of considerable magnitude: our bachelor's dissertations remained in a state of incompletion.

Thus we found ourselves ensconced in jungle hostels and mountain settlements, the luminescence of laptop screens punctuating hammocks and modest accommodations. During diurnal hours, we explored with abandon—meandering through Cartagena's evocative colonial thoroughfares redolent with history, traversing the coffee region's verdant hillsides, contemplating Medellín's remarkable metamorphosis from its notorious history to contemporary efflorescence. Post sunset, we typed with considerable urgency upon our respective devices.

The juxtaposition was patently, magnificently absurd. Composing rigorous academic treatises on autonomous drone systems whilst simians vocalized cacophonously in the arboreal surroundings beyond our windows. Perspiration cascading upon keyboards in the equatorial humidity whilst theoretical frameworks demanded explication. Yet somehow, improbably, miraculously, the disparate elements coalesced into submissions of acceptable scholastic merit.

The month dissipated in a kaleidoscopic blur of overnight buses, Caribbean littorals, and bibliographic citations. When we finally executed the submission command from a cramped internet establishment somewhere in Colombia's interior, the relief manifested almost corporeally. Years of accumulated endeavor—the academic study, the mechanical construction, the competitive striving, the interminable composition—all of it conclusively, irrevocably terminated.

Tim embarked upon his return trajectory to Europe to commence his subsequent chapter. I proceeded to Barcelona to inaugurate mine. Divergent trajectories, disparate destinations, yet the same adamantine friendship forged through the crucible of shared adversity.

The succeeding adventure awaited its commencement.
