# Backpacking Colombia

We won the biggest competition. We were very happy.

Tim and I flew to Colombia. We traveled for one month in South America.

We needed this vacation. After years of drones and stress, we needed to rest.

But we had one problem: We still had to write our theses.

So we worked in hostels and hotels. By day, we explored. By night, we wrote.

We saw Cartagena. We saw mountains and beaches. We saw Medellín.

It was strange. We wrote about drones while monkeys screamed outside.

After one month, we finished. We sent our theses from an internet café.

The relief was big. Years of work were done.

Tim went back to Europe. I went to Barcelona.

The next chapter started.
