# Backpacking Colombia

We'd just won the biggest competition of our lives. The sensible thing to do would have been to fly home and celebrate with family and friends.

Instead, Tim and I flew to Colombia for a month of backpacking through South America.

We deserved this. We desperately needed this. After years of drone parts, sleepless nights, and relentless stress, we needed to simply exist for a while—to be travelers rather than engineers, adventurers rather than competitors.

There was just one catch: we still had our bachelor's theses to complete.

So there we found ourselves, in jungle hostels and mountain towns, laptop screens glowing in hammocks and budget hotels. By day, we explored—wandering Cartagena's atmospheric colonial streets, hiking through the coffee country's emerald hills, marveling at Medellín's remarkable transformation from its infamous past. By night, we typed furiously.

The situation was utterly absurd. We were composing academic papers about drone systems while monkeys shrieked in the trees outside our windows. Perspiration dripped onto our keyboards in the tropical humidity. But somehow, improbably, it all came together.

The month dissolved in a blur of overnight buses, Caribbean beaches, and bibliography citations. When we finally hit "submit" from a cramped internet café somewhere in Colombia, the relief was almost physical. Years of accumulated work—the studying, the building, the competing, the endless writing—all of it finally concluded.

Tim headed back to Europe to begin his next chapter. I headed to Barcelona to begin mine. Different flights, different destinations, but the same unbreakable friendship forged through shared trials.

The next adventure was ready to commence.
