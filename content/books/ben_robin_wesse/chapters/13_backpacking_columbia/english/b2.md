# Backpacking Columbia

We'd just won the biggest competition of our lives. The reasonable thing to do would have been to go home and celebrate.

Instead, Tim and I flew to Colombia.

One month of backpacking through South America, fresh from victory in Alabama. We deserved this. We needed this. After years of drone parts and all-nighters and stress, we needed to just... exist.

The only problem: we still had bachelor's theses to write.

So there we were, in jungle hostels and mountain towns, laptops glowing in hammocks and cheap hotels. By day, we explored—Cartagena's colonial streets, the coffee country's green hills, Medellín's transformation from infamous to incredible. By night, we typed.

It was absurd. Writing academic papers about drone systems while monkeys screamed in the trees outside. Debugging theoretical frameworks while sweat dripped onto keyboards. But somehow, it worked.

The month passed in a blur of buses, beaches, and bibliography citations. When we finally submitted our theses from an internet café somewhere in Colombia, the relief was physical. Years of work—the studying, the building, the competing, the writing—all of it done.

Tim headed back to Europe. I headed to Barcelona. Different flights, different destinations, same friendship forged in fire.

The next chapter was about to begin.
