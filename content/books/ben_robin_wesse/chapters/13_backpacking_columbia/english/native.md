# Backpacking Colombia

So there we were—fresh off winning the biggest competition of our lives—and instead of going home like normal people, Tim and I just... flew to Colombia.

I mean, why not, right? A month of backpacking through South America, riding high on our Alabama victory. We needed this so bad. Years of drone parts everywhere, pulling all-nighters, stress eating, stress not-eating—we just needed to, like, exist for a bit.

One tiny problem though: we still had our bachelor's theses to finish.

So picture this: jungle hostels, mountain towns, laptops glowing in hammocks and sketchy hotel rooms. Days spent exploring—getting lost in Cartagena's colonial maze, hiking through coffee country, losing our minds over how Medellín transformed itself. Nights spent frantically typing.

It was completely ridiculous. There I was, writing about drone systems while actual monkeys were screaming outside my window. Sweat dripping on my keyboard. Citations getting messed up because the WiFi kept dying. But somehow? We made it work.

The whole month was just buses, beaches, and bibliography entries. When we finally hit submit from some random internet café in the middle of Colombia, I swear the relief was physical. Like actually felt it in my body. Years of work—done. Just like that.

Tim headed back to Europe. I headed to Barcelona. Different flights, same friendship that'd survived all that craziness together.

New chapter coming up.
