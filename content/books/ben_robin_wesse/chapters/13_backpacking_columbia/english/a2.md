# Backpacking Colombia

We had just won the biggest competition of our lives. Normally, we would go home and celebrate.

But instead, Tim and I flew to Colombia. We wanted to travel for one month.

We really needed this vacation. After years of building drones and working all night, we needed to relax and just exist.

But there was one problem: We still had to write our bachelor's theses.

So there we were, in jungle hostels and mountain towns. Our laptops were glowing in hammocks and cheap hotels. By day, we explored Colombia. By night, we wrote our theses.

We visited Cartagena and saw the colonial streets. We went to the coffee country with its green hills. We saw how Medellín had changed from a dangerous city to an incredible one.

It was very strange. We were writing academic papers about drone systems while monkeys screamed in the trees outside. But somehow, it worked.

The month passed quickly. Buses, beaches, and bibliography citations filled our days. When we finally sent our theses from an internet café, we felt great relief. Years of work were finally done.

Tim went back to Europe. I went to Barcelona. We had different destinations but the same strong friendship.

The next chapter was about to begin.
