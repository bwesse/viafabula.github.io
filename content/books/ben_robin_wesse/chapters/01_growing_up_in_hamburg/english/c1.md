# Growing Up in Hamburg

Origins are curious things. They shape us fundamentally yet often feel inadequate to explain who we become. Ben Robin Wesse's origins lie in Hamburg—that storied Hanseatic port where the Elbe meets the North Sea, where centuries of maritime trade have cultivated a particular breed of pragmatic cosmopolitanism. Understanding Hamburg means understanding the first chapter of Ben's story, not because the city determined his path but because it provided the raw materials from which he would eventually construct one.

Hamburg occupies a peculiar position in German geography and psychology. Neither fully Northern European in its austere reserve nor Mediterranean in its emotional expressiveness, it exists in a productive tension between commerce and culture, tradition and innovation. The city's enormous port—consistently ranking among Europe's busiest—serves as a constant reminder that isolation is neither possible nor desirable, that the flow of goods and ideas connects even the most firmly rooted place to everywhere else.

It was in this environment of perpetual exchange that Ben spent his formative years. The son of parents whose specific identities need not concern us but whose parenting philosophy merits attention, he was granted unusual latitude to pursue his interests. This freedom proved formative in ways that formal education could never replicate.

From earliest childhood, Ben exhibited what educators might charitably term "kinesthetic learning preferences" and what his parents more simply recognized as an inability to leave mechanical objects intact. Toys were never merely played with but disassembled, examined, occasionally reassembled, and frequently rendered permanently non-functional in the pursuit of understanding. His bedroom evolved into something resembling a workshop, its surfaces perpetually covered with screws, gears, circuit boards, and the occasional scorch mark from experiments that exceeded their intended parameters.

The contemporary discourse around childhood curiosity tends to romanticize such tendencies. In truth, raising a child who reflexively dismantles every device in the household requires considerable patience and no small tolerance for chaos. Ben's parents demonstrated both, recognizing that their son's unconventional approach to learning, however inconvenient, was genuine engagement with the physical world—something no amount of textbook study could replicate.

The German educational system, product of Enlightenment ideals filtered through centuries of institutional development, proved less sympathetic to Ben's particular genius. Its emphasis on structured learning, standardized assessment, and predetermined curricula left little room for the kind of exploratory, self-directed education that Ben instinctively preferred. His academic record reflected this mismatch: stellar performance in applied subjects where theoretical concepts connected to tangible outcomes, mediocre or worse in those requiring abstract memorization without apparent purpose.

What the system failed to measure—what no standardized test could capture—was the parallel curriculum Ben was developing independently. The internet, still in its relatively early phase of democratizing information, provided access to knowledge that previous generations could never have imagined. Online tutorials, maker communities, and open-source documentation became his real university. There, curiosity wasn't punished but celebrated; failure wasn't stigmatized but recognized as an essential component of learning.

The harbor remained his psychological anchor throughout these years. There is something profoundly affecting about watching enormous vessels arrive from distant continents, their cargo representing countless human stories of production and consumption, hope and necessity. For a young person already sensing that his story would require a larger canvas than Hamburg could provide, those ships represented possibility itself—tangible evidence that the world extended far beyond the familiar streets of his hometown.

The opportunity for an exchange year in Canada arrived at precisely the right moment. Ben was old enough to benefit from the experience yet young enough to be fundamentally shaped by it. More importantly, he was ready—ready to test himself against unfamiliar circumstances, ready to discover whether the person he was becoming could survive, even thrive, when transplanted to foreign soil.

Hamburg would always remain his foundation—the place where he learned to question, to build, to fail productively. But as he prepared to cross the Atlantic for the first time, Ben understood intuitively what this narrative will make explicit: that his story, whatever its eventual shape, would require many more settings before reaching its conclusion.
