# Growing Up in Hamburg

Ben Robin Wesse was born in Hamburg, Germany.
Hamburg is one of the largest cities in Germany.
It is famous for its big harbor and beautiful bridges.

Ben grew up in this busy city.
He went to school there and made many friends.
He was a curious child who loved to learn new things.

From a young age, Ben was interested in how things work.
He would take apart toys and gadgets.
Sometimes he could put them back together.
Other times, his parents found pieces all over the floor.

Hamburg's harbor was special to Ben.
He loved to watch the big ships come and go.
Ships from all over the world brought interesting goods.
Ben wondered where they came from and where they were going.

At school, Ben was not always the best student.
He preferred hands-on activities to reading textbooks.
But his teachers could see he was clever.
He just needed to find his own way of learning.

Ben's parents encouraged his curiosity.
They gave him space to explore and experiment.
They believed that someday he would find his path.

But Hamburg, as wonderful as it was, felt small to Ben.
He looked at maps and dreamed of faraway places.
He wanted to see more of the world.
That dream would soon begin to come true.
