# Growing Up in Hamburg

Ben was born in Hamburg.
Hamburg is a big city.
It is in Germany.

Ben lived there as a child.
He went to school there.
He had friends there.

Hamburg has a big port.
Ships come from everywhere.
Ben liked to watch the ships.

Ben liked to build things.
He took things apart.
He wanted to know how they work.

His parents were kind.
They let him explore.
They let him be curious.

Ben was not a perfect student.
But he was smart.
He liked to learn on his own.

Hamburg was home.
But Ben wanted to see more.
He dreamed of other places.
