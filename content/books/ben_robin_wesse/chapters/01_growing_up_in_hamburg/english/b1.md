# Growing Up in Hamburg

The story of Ben Robin Wesse begins, as all stories must, at the beginning—in Hamburg, Germany, a city where the Elbe River meets the North Sea and where commerce has flowed for centuries.

Hamburg, with its approximately two million inhabitants, is no ordinary German city. It carries the legacy of the Hanseatic League, a medieval trading confederation that once dominated European commerce. The city's enormous port—one of the largest in Europe—serves as a gateway between continents, a constant reminder that the world extends far beyond any single place.

It was in this environment of movement and exchange that Ben spent his formative years. The son of supportive parents who valued curiosity over conformity, he was given unusual freedom to explore his interests. And his interests, even from childhood, tended toward the mechanical and the technical.

While his classmates collected football cards or practiced instruments, Ben collected broken electronics. His bedroom served as both a laboratory and a graveyard for disassembled gadgets. Radios, clocks, computer components—anything with moving parts or circuitry eventually found its way into his hands and, inevitably, into pieces.

Not all experiments ended successfully. There were minor explosions, electrical shorts, and countless devices that never functioned again. But each failure taught him something new about how the world worked, lessons that no textbook could provide.

School presented its own challenges. Ben was never a student who fit neatly into the German educational system's expectations. He excelled in subjects that allowed practical application—physics, mathematics when tied to real problems—but struggled with subjects that demanded memorization without understanding. His grades reflected this inconsistency, frustrating teachers who could see his potential but couldn't reach it through traditional methods.

What saved Ben from academic mediocrity was his genuine passion for learning—on his own terms. Outside of school, he devoured information about robotics, electronics, and emerging technologies. The internet became his university, YouTube tutorials his lectures.

Hamburg's harbor remained his favorite place in the city. Watching container ships arrive from Shanghai, Cape Town, and Santos sparked questions about the wider world. What were those places like? What adventures awaited beyond the familiar streets of his hometown?

These questions would eventually lead Ben across oceans and continents. But first, he had to finish school—and along the way, an opportunity would arise that would change everything: a chance to spend a year in Canada.
