# Growing Up in Hamburg

Hamburg was the world Ben Robin Wesse knew first. Germany's second-largest city, famous for its massive port and network of canals, provided an interesting backdrop for a curious young mind.

Growing up in this bustling metropolis, Ben was surrounded by the constant movement of commerce and culture. The harbor, where ships from every corner of the globe docked daily, sparked his imagination. He would spend hours watching cargo containers being loaded and unloaded, wondering about the journeys they represented.

From an early age, Ben displayed an unusual fascination with mechanical objects. While other children played with their toys, Ben preferred to disassemble them. Radios, remote-controlled cars, broken appliances—nothing was safe from his curious hands. His bedroom often resembled a workshop more than a child's room, with screws, gears, and circuit boards scattered across every surface.

His parents recognized this trait and, instead of discouraging it, provided him with tools and space to experiment. They understood that their son was learning in his own way, even if it didn't always match what was expected at school.

School, in fact, was a mixed experience for Ben. The theoretical subjects felt disconnected from the real world he wanted to understand. He excelled when he could apply concepts practically but struggled with memorization and abstract lectures. His report cards were inconsistent—excellent in some subjects, mediocre in others.

What Ben lacked in traditional academic discipline, he made up for in creativity and determination. When something captured his interest, he would pursue it relentlessly until he understood it completely.

Hamburg gave Ben a solid foundation, but even as a teenager, he sensed that his journey would take him far beyond the city's borders. The ships in the harbor weren't just vessels—they were invitations to adventure. And Ben was ready to accept.
