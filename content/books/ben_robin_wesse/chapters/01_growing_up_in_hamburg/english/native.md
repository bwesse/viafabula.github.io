# Growing Up in Hamburg

Hamburg. Where the rain never seems to take a day off and the harbor smells like salt and diesel and possibility.

I grew up there, in this sprawling port city where ships from every corner of the planet show up like it's the most normal thing in the world. Which, I guess, it is—at least in Hamburg. The city's been doing the whole international trade thing for about eight hundred years, so they've gotten pretty good at it.

My childhood was... let's call it unconventional. While most kids were playing with their toys, I was taking mine apart. Remote-controlled cars? Disassembled within hours. Old radios? Same. Anything my parents made the mistake of throwing away instead of actually throwing away? Fair game.

My room looked like a electronics recycling center exploded in it. Wires everywhere. Screws in little piles. Circuit boards laid out like I was performing surgery—which, in a way, I was. I wanted to understand how things worked, and the only way I knew how to do that was to see what was inside.

My parents, bless them, didn't freak out. They got me tools. They cleared out space in the garage. They pretended not to notice when things occasionally started smoking. Looking back, I'm pretty sure they were just hoping I wouldn't burn the house down. I mostly didn't.

School was a different story. The German system is very... structured. There's a right way to learn, apparently, and whatever I was doing wasn't it. I'd ace the hands-on stuff and bomb the memorization. My report cards were a rollercoaster—brilliant in physics, disaster in history, completely average in everything else.

Teachers kept telling me I had "potential" but needed to "apply myself." I never really understood what that meant. I was applying myself—just to the stuff I actually cared about.

The harbor saved me, in a way. Whenever school got too frustrating or my room felt too small, I'd head down to the water and watch the ships. Container vessels the size of apartment buildings, coming from places I could barely imagine. Each one was proof that the world was huge and full of stuff I hadn't seen yet.

I knew, even then, that I wouldn't stay in Hamburg forever. The question was where I'd go and what I'd do when I got there.

That's when Canada happened.
