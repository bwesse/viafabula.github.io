# Growing Up in Hamburg

Every life is shaped by its geography, and Ben Robin Wesse's story is no exception. Hamburg—that ancient Hanseatic city where the Elbe empties into the North Sea—provided the setting for his earliest chapters. It was here, amid rain-slicked streets and the perpetual motion of one of Europe's busiest ports, that a curious young man began to understand both the world's mechanisms and his own restless nature.

Hamburg is a city of contradictions. It embraces Northern European reserve while maintaining surprising cosmopolitan warmth. Its citizens pride themselves on both tradition and innovation, on maritime heritage and contemporary arts. For a child like Ben, growing up surrounded by these tensions meant learning early that life rarely presents simple choices between opposing values.

The Wesse household, from all accounts, was one that valued exploration over rigid expectation. Ben's parents recognized early that their son marched to a different rhythm than his peers. While other children were content to play with toys as intended, Ben needed to understand what made them work. The natural consequence was a childhood marked by disassembled electronics, jury-rigged contraptions, and the occasional small-scale explosion.

The family's tolerance for this behavior was crucial. In another household, such tendencies might have been discouraged in favor of more conventional pursuits. Instead, Ben was provided with space, tools, and—perhaps most importantly—permission to fail. His parents understood intuitively what educational research would later confirm: that hands-on experimentation, even when it results in broken devices and singed eyebrows, builds deeper understanding than passive instruction.

The German school system, however, was less accommodating. Built on centuries of pedagogical tradition, it valued discipline, memorization, and adherence to established curricula. Ben's unconventional approach to learning—his tendency to question rather than accept, to experiment rather than absorb—placed him at constant odds with institutional expectations.

His grades told a story of extremes. In subjects where he saw practical application—physics, certain mathematics, anything involving building or designing—he excelled. But in subjects requiring rote learning or abstract theorizing disconnected from tangible outcomes, he struggled. More than one teacher noted his potential while lamenting his apparent inability to channel it productively.

What his teachers couldn't see was the parallel education Ben was providing himself. Evenings and weekends disappeared into online tutorials, maker forums, and self-directed projects. He taught himself the basics of electronics, programming, and mechanical design—not for any exam, but because understanding these systems felt essential in ways he couldn't fully articulate.

The harbor remained his sanctuary. Among the towering cranes and endless rows of shipping containers, Ben found a connection to something larger than himself. Each vessel represented a journey, each cargo a story of global interconnection. The boy who would one day build drones and travel across continents first dreamed those dreams while watching ships from Hamburg's waterfront.

As high school progressed, a new possibility emerged: an exchange year in Canada. The opportunity seemed tailor-made for someone of Ben's temperament—a chance to test himself in an unfamiliar environment, to learn not just new subjects but new ways of being. With characteristic directness, he applied.

Hamburg would always remain his foundation. But even then, standing on the precipice of his first major adventure, Ben sensed that his story would require a much larger canvas.
