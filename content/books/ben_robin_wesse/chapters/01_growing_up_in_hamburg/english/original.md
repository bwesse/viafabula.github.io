# Growing Up in Hamburg

I need to start somewhere, and Hamburg is as good a place as any. It's where I was born, where I grew up, where I first started taking things apart to figure out how they worked—much to my parents' mixed delight and horror.

Hamburg is this massive port city in northern Germany. Ships everywhere. Rain everywhere. Fish sandwiches that tourists think are gross until they try them. It's not the prettiest city in Germany, but it has this energy, you know? Like it's connected to everywhere else in the world through all those shipping lanes.

I was a weird kid. Not in a bad way, just... different. My toys had a life expectancy of about three hours before I'd crack them open to see what made them tick. By the time I was twelve, my bedroom was basically a disaster zone of wires, screws, and half-functional gadgets I'd Frankensteined together from other dead gadgets.

My parents handled it surprisingly well. Instead of telling me to clean up my mess and be normal, they bought me a soldering iron and cleared out part of the garage. I think they figured if I was going to be building stuff anyway, I might as well have a proper space for it. That, or they were tired of finding screws in the washing machine.

School was a constant battle. The German education system is not designed for kids who learn by doing. It's designed for kids who sit still, take notes, and regurgitate information on tests. I was terrible at sitting still. Worse at regurgitating. But give me a physics problem I could actually visualize, or a math concept I could apply to building something, and suddenly I was paying attention.

My grades reflected this perfectly inconsistent approach to learning. Some teachers thought I was brilliant. Others thought I was a lost cause. The truth was probably somewhere in between.

What saved me from going crazy was the harbor. I'd bike down there after school and just... watch. These massive container ships coming in from Shanghai and Singapore and São Paulo. Each one was a reminder that the world was enormous and I'd barely seen any of it.

I'd stand there imagining where I might go someday. Canada, maybe? South America? Somewhere with mountains and snow for snowboarding?

I didn't know it then, but all of those places were waiting for me. I just had to get through high school first—and before that, I had an adventure in Canada to experience.

But that's the next chapter.
