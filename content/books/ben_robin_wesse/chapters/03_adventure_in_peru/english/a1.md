# Adventure in Peru

After finishing high school, Ben made an unusual choice.
While most of his friends went straight to university, Ben decided to travel.
He wanted to explore South America, and Peru was his destination.

Peru is a country of amazing diversity.
It has tall mountains called the Andes.
It has thick jungles in the Amazon.
It has ancient ruins from the Inca civilization.
Ben wanted to see it all.

He traveled with a backpack and a limited budget.
He stayed in hostels and ate local food.
He walked for hours to reach remote villages.
He climbed to see Machu Picchu, the famous lost city.

During his months in Peru, Ben had time to think.
He was looking for answers about his future.
What should he study?
What career should he pursue?
Where did he want to live?

Ben learned some Spanish during his trip.
He talked to travelers from many countries.
He discovered that many people were also searching for their path.
He was not alone in feeling uncertain.

The trip did not give Ben all the answers.
But it gave him something important.
He learned to trust the journey.
He learned that uncertainty was okay.
He would find his way eventually.

When Ben finally returned to Germany, he was ready for the next step.
He just needed to figure out where to go.
