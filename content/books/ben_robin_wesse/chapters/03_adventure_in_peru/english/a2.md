# Adventure in Peru

With his Abitur freshly earned, Ben stood at a crossroads familiar to many young adults: the question of what comes next. Unlike most of his classmates, who immediately enrolled in universities, Ben felt unprepared to commit to a specific path. He needed time to think, and he decided to find that time in South America.

Peru called to him for reasons he couldn't fully explain. Perhaps it was the mystery of ancient civilizations. Perhaps it was the dramatic landscapes—the soaring Andes, the vast Amazon, the arid coastal deserts. Or perhaps it was simply the allure of the truly foreign, a place different enough from Germany to force him out of familiar patterns.

Ben packed a backpack and bought a one-way ticket to Lima. He had saved money from odd jobs and gifts, enough for several months of budget travel. He would stay in hostels, eat street food, and move slowly through the country, giving himself space to think about the future.

The reality of Peru exceeded his expectations. The colors were more vivid, the flavors more intense, the landscapes more dramatic than anything photographs had suggested. He hiked through valleys where Inca terraces still carved the mountainsides. He wandered colonial plazas in cities that had stood for centuries. He ventured into the Amazon, where the forest seemed to breathe around him.

But Peru was more than scenery. It was also a classroom. Ben's Spanish, rudimentary at first, improved rapidly through necessity. He learned to negotiate prices, ask for directions, and eventually have real conversations with locals and fellow travelers alike. The language opened doors that would otherwise have remained closed.

During those months, Ben spent many hours in contemplation. He knew he was interested in robotics and engineering, but he didn't know where to study. He wanted more than just a good program—he wanted a place worth living, somewhere that offered more than just academics. This realization would eventually lead him to Klagenfurt, though he didn't know it yet.

When Ben finally returned to Germany, he was tanned, tired, and transformed. The uncertainty remained, but it no longer frightened him. He had learned that the path forward often reveals itself only to those willing to walk without knowing the destination.

Now it was time to find a university. And Ben had a specific set of criteria in mind.
