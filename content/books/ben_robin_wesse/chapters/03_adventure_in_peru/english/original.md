# Adventure in Peru

Most people, after finishing high school, go directly to university. I went to Peru.

I know, I know. It sounds like the privileged gap year cliché—young person finds themselves while backpacking through exotic locations. But that's not quite what this was. I wasn't trying to find myself. I was trying to figure out what the hell I wanted to do with my life, and I needed distance from everything familiar to do it.

Peru chose itself, honestly. I wanted somewhere far, somewhere different, somewhere that would force me to think differently. South America fit the bill. And within South America, Peru had everything: Andean peaks, Amazon jungle, coastal deserts, and enough ancient history to keep my mind occupied for months.

I traveled cheap. Hostels, overnight buses, street food that probably should have made me sick but somehow didn't. I learned to read a menu in Spanish, then to have conversations, then to debate politics with locals in broken sentences. The language came faster than I expected—necessity is an excellent teacher.

But Peru wasn't just a language immersion program. It was a thinking retreat. I spent hours watching landscapes scroll past bus windows, contemplating the same questions again and again. What do I want? Where do I want to be? What matters to me?

The answers came slowly, incomplete at first, then gradually clearer. I wanted to work with robots, with things that moved and responded to their environment. I wanted to be somewhere beautiful, somewhere with mountains and snow. I wanted a life that combined intellectual challenge with physical adventure.

I didn't know yet that Klagenfurt existed. But I was developing the criteria that would eventually lead me there: robotics program + mountains + snowboarding + affordable cost of living. The Venn diagram wasn't large, but somewhere in the overlap was my future.

When I returned to Germany, my parents were relieved. My tan had faded by the time I started researching universities, but the clarity I'd gained in Peru remained. It was time to find my place. And against all odds, I was about to find it in Austria.
