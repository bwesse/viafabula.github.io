# Adventure in Peru

Peru after graduation. It wasn't what anyone expected.

Most of my classmates had their plans sorted—university applications submitted, future careers roughly sketched, life on a predictable track. I had... questions. Too many of them. And a conviction that I wouldn't find answers sitting in another classroom.

So I bought a one-way ticket to Lima. My parents weren't thrilled, but they'd learned by now that I did things my own way. "Just come back eventually," my mom said. "And call once in a while." Fair enough.

Peru destroyed me in the best possible way. Everything I thought I knew about the world got turned upside down. The scale of the landscape was incomprehensible—mountains that made the Alps look like hills, jungles that seemed to go on forever, ancient cities hidden in clouds. And the history! Walking through Machu Picchu, I kept thinking about the Incas who built it, working without metal tools, without wheels, and creating something that has lasted five hundred years.

I learned Spanish by necessity. My high school English was useless here, and my German even more so. Within weeks, I was bargaining in markets, ordering meals, asking for directions. By month two, I was having actual conversations about life, the universe, and everything in between.

But the real education happened in the quiet moments. Sitting on a bus winding through mountain passes. Lying in a hammock in the Amazon, listening to the jungle come alive at night. Drinking pisco sours with other travelers and swapping stories about where we'd been and where we were going.

I kept asking myself the same questions. What do I want to study? What kind of life do I want to build? Where should I go?

I didn't find definitive answers. But I found something better: comfort with uncertainty. The realization that not knowing is okay. That the path reveals itself to those who keep walking.

When I finally flew home, I was ready. I still didn't know exactly what I wanted. But I knew I needed a place with mountains, good weather, and a program in robotics. That combination would lead me somewhere unexpected: a small Austrian city called Klagenfurt.

But that's the next chapter.
