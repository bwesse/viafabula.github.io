# Adventure in Peru

Ben finished high school.
He got his diploma.
But he did not go to university.
Not yet.

Ben wanted to travel.
He wanted to see South America.
He chose Peru.

Peru is far away.
It has mountains and jungles.
It has old ruins.
The Incas lived there.

Ben traveled for months.
He walked a lot.
He saw beautiful things.
He met nice people.

Ben also thought a lot.
What should I do?
What should I study?
Where should I live?

He did not find all the answers.
But he learned something.
He could figure things out.
He could take his time.

Peru was an adventure.
And the adventure was not over.
