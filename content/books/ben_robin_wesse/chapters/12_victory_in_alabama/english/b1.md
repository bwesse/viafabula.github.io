# Victory in Alabama

Huntsville, Alabama. The final competition. This was what we had worked so hard for.

We built two new drones: RED and BULL. They were bigger than the London drones. More power. More sensors. I designed them in Fusion 360.

Before leaving Austria, I printed backup parts for everything. Frames, motor mounts, landing gear. If something could break, I had a spare.

This was the best decision I ever made.

The competition started badly. We got big batteries—the same ones that caused crashes before. On the first test, BULL dropped from the sky. It crashed hard.

That night, I rebuilt BULL. I used my backup parts. By morning, it was flying again.

Then RED crashed too. The expensive sensor broke. Two broken drones, one day before the final.

I didn't sleep. Tim worked on code. I fixed the hardware. The spare parts saved us.

Competition day came. RED flew perfectly. The best of all teams!

One problem: our teammate's code wasn't ready. ChatGPT helped us write it. It was crazy, but it worked.

Team Klagenfurt won the SAPIENCE competition!

Standing on stage with the trophy, I thought about my journey. The art kid from Hamburg. The guy who missed his math exam for snowboarding. The uncertain young man who moved to Austria.

We did it. Tim and I actually did it.
