# Victory in Alabama

Huntsville, Alabama. The big moment. Everything came down to this.

We built two new drones: RED and BULL. Bigger than our London ones, with larger propellers, batteries, and more sensors. I designed everything in Fusion 360 and 3D-printed the parts.

Smart move on my part: I printed backup parts for everything before leaving Austria. Frames, motor mounts, landing gear—if it could break, I had a spare.

Best. Decision. Ever.

Competition started rough. They gave us batteries bigger than we'd tested—the ones that made us crash back home. Sure enough, first test flight, BULL dropped like a rock. Boom.

That night, I rebuilt BULL completely. Backup parts saved us. Flying again by morning.

Then RED crashed too. Expensive LiDAR sensor shattered. Two broken drones, one day before finals.

No sleep. Tim on code, me on hardware. Part by part, brought both back to life.

Competition day: RED flew perfectly. Best results of all teams. Our autonomous systems nailed it.

One problem: teammate's code wasn't finished. Desperate times—ChatGPT helped us write it. Crazy? Maybe. But it worked.

Team Klagenfurt won SAPIENCE in Huntsville, Alabama.

Standing on stage with the trophy, I thought about everything. Art kid from Hamburg. Guy who missed his math exam for snowboarding. Uncertain kid who packed a backpack and snowboard and moved to Austria.

We actually did it. Tim and I freaking won.
