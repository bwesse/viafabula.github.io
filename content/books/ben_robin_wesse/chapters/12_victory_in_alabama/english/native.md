# Victory in Alabama

Huntsville, Alabama. The final competition. Everything we'd worked for came down to this.

We'd built two new drones for this competition: RED and BULL. Bigger than the London drones, with larger propellers, bigger batteries, more sensors. The outdoor scenario demanded more range, more power, more everything. I'd spent countless hours in Fusion 360 designing every component, then printed them on our 3D printers back in Klagenfurt.

I came prepared. Before leaving Austria, I printed backup parts for everything that could possibly break. Frames, motor mounts, landing gear, sensor housings—if it could crack, I had a spare.

It turned out to be the smartest decision I ever made.

The competition started badly. We were given batteries larger than what we'd tested with—the same size that had caused crashes back home. Sure enough, on the first test flight, BULL dropped from the sky like a rock. Uncontrollable. Crashed hard.

That night, I rebuilt BULL from scratch. Replaced the broken frame with my backup parts. Recalibrated everything. Got it flying again by morning.

Then RED crashed. The super-expensive LiDAR sensor shattered on impact. Two broken drones, one day before the final task.

I didn't sleep. Neither did Tim. While he worked on the code, I worked on the hardware. Part by part, piece by piece, I brought both drones back to life. The spares I'd printed in Klagenfurt saved us.

Competition day arrived. Only RED was fully ready, but it performed flawlessly. The best results of all teams. Our autonomous systems worked exactly as designed.

There was one problem: our teammate's code for the final task wasn't finished. In desperation, we turned to ChatGPT to help write the remaining functions. It was unconventional, maybe even a bit crazy, but it worked.

Team Klagenfurt won the SAPIENCE competition in Huntsville, Alabama.

Standing on that stage, holding the trophy, I thought about the journey. The art kid from Hamburg who'd never touched a robot. The guy who missed his first math exam because he was snowboarding. The uncertain young man who packed a backpack and a snowboard and moved to Austria hoping for the best.

We did it. Tim and I actually did it.
