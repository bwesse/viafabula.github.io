# Victory in Alabama

Huntsville, Alabama. The final competition awaited us. Everything we had worked for culminated in this moment.

We had constructed two new drones for this competition: RED and BULL. Larger than our London machines, they featured bigger propellers, more powerful batteries, and additional sensors. The outdoor scenario demanded greater range and capability. I had invested countless hours designing every component in Fusion 360, then printing them on our 3D printers back in Klagenfurt.

I arrived thoroughly prepared. Before departing Austria, I printed backup parts for everything that could potentially fail. Frames, motor mounts, landing gear, sensor housings—if it could crack, I had a replacement ready.

This preparation proved to be the wisest decision I ever made.

The competition began disastrously. We were provided with batteries larger than what we had tested—the same size that had caused crashes during training. Predictably, on the first test flight, BULL plummeted from the sky uncontrollably, crashing hard.

That night, I rebuilt BULL entirely from scratch, replacing the damaged frame with my backup components. I recalibrated everything and had it operational again by morning.

Subsequently, RED crashed as well. The expensive LiDAR sensor shattered upon impact. Two broken drones, one day remaining before the final task.

Sleep became impossible for both of us. While Tim focused on the software, I concentrated on the hardware. Component by component, I restored both drones to functionality. The spare parts I had printed in Klagenfurt saved our competition.

Competition day finally arrived. Only RED was completely ready, yet it performed flawlessly, achieving the best results among all teams. Our autonomous systems executed precisely as designed.

One significant problem remained: our teammate's code for the final task was incomplete. In desperation, we turned to ChatGPT to help write the remaining functions. It was unconventional, perhaps slightly reckless, but it succeeded.

Team Klagenfurt won the SAPIENCE competition in Huntsville, Alabama.

Standing upon that stage, trophy in hand, I reflected upon my journey. The art student from Hamburg who had never touched robotics. The young man who missed his first math exam because snowboarding beckoned. The uncertain youth who packed a backpack and a snowboard and relocated to Austria hoping for the best.

We actually accomplished it. Tim and I genuinely succeeded.
