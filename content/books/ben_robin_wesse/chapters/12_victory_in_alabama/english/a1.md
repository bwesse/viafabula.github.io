# Victory in Alabama

Ben and Tim went to Huntsville, Alabama.
This was the final drone competition.
They worked very hard for this day.

Ben built two new drones.
They were called RED and BULL.
The drones were bigger than before.
They had larger propellers and more sensors.

Ben was very smart.
Before he left Austria, he printed extra parts.
He printed parts for everything that could break.

The competition started badly.
They got bigger batteries than they tested with.
On the first test, BULL crashed hard.
It fell from the sky.

That night, Ben worked very hard.
He rebuilt BULL with his backup parts.
By morning, it was flying again.

Then RED crashed too.
An expensive sensor broke.
Now both drones were broken.

Ben did not sleep.
Tim worked on the computer code.
Ben fixed the hardware.
Part by part, he fixed both drones.

Competition day arrived.
RED flew perfectly.
It got the best results of all teams!

There was one problem.
Some code was not finished.
They used ChatGPT to help write it.
It was a crazy idea, but it worked!

Team Klagenfurt won the competition!
Ben and Tim were so happy.

Ben thought about his journey.
He was an art student from Hamburg.
Now he won a drone competition in America.
