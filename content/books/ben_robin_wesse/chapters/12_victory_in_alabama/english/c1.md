# Victory in Alabama

Huntsville, Alabama. The ultimate competitive arena. The culmination of all our endeavours awaited judgement.

We had engineered two new aerial platforms for this engagement: RED and BULL. Substantially larger than our London predecessors, they incorporated augmented propulsion systems, enhanced battery capacity, and expanded sensor arrays. The outdoor operational scenario demanded extended range, increased power reserves, and comprehensive capability upgrades. I had dedicated innumerable hours within Fusion 360's digital environment, meticulously designing every component before manufacturing them via our additive fabrication systems in Klagenfurt.

I arrived with comprehensive contingency preparations. Prior to departing Austrian soil, I had produced redundant components for every conceivable failure point. Structural frames, motor mounting assemblies, landing apparatus, sensor housings—any element susceptible to damage had a ready replacement awaiting deployment.

This foresight proved to constitute the most prescient decision of my engineering career.

The competition commenced inauspiciously. Competition authorities provided batteries exceeding our tested specifications—precisely the configuration that had precipitated catastrophic failures during domestic trials. Inevitably, during initial flight testing, BULL descended uncontrollably from altitude, impacting the terrain with considerable force.

That evening, I undertook BULL's complete reconstruction, substituting the compromised structural elements with my prepared redundancies. Following comprehensive recalibration procedures, operational status was restored by dawn.

Subsequently, RED suffered identical fate. The extraordinarily expensive LiDAR apparatus shattered upon impact. Two incapacitated aerial platforms, mere hours before the culminating competitive task.

Sleep became an impossibility for both parties. While Tim devoted himself to software refinement, I focused exclusively upon hardware restoration. Component by component, subsystem by subsystem, I resuscitated both platforms. The contingency parts fabricated in Klagenfurt proved salvational.

Competition day materialised. Only RED achieved complete operational readiness, yet its performance proved impeccable, generating superior results across all participating teams. Our autonomous navigation systems executed with precise fidelity to design specifications.

One critical complication persisted: our colleague's code for the final task remained incomplete. In extremis, we engaged ChatGPT to assist in composing the remaining functional elements. Unconventional, perhaps bordering on audacious, but ultimately efficacious.

Team Klagenfurt emerged victorious from the SAPIENCE competition in Huntsville, Alabama.

Positioned upon that ceremonial platform, clutching the trophy, I contemplated my extraordinary trajectory. The fine arts student from Hamburg who had never encountered robotics. The youth who had forfeited his inaugural mathematics examination for the mountains' siren call. The uncertain young man who had assembled a backpack and a snowboard, relocating to Austria sustained only by optimism.

We had genuinely accomplished this. Tim and I had authentically succeeded.
