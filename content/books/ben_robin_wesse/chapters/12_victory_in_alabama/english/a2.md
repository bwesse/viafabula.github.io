# Victory in Alabama

Ben goes to America. It is a big competition.

Ben has two drones. RED and BULL. The drones are big.

One drone crashes. Ben is sad. But he fixes it.

Another drone crashes. Ben works all night. He fixes both drones.

On competition day, the drone flies well. It is the best!

Ben and Tim win! They are very happy.

Ben was an art student. Now he builds drones. He smiles.
