# Victory in Alabama

Ben goes to America.
He goes to Alabama.
There is a big competition.

Ben built two drones.
They are called RED and BULL.
The drones are big.

One drone crashes.
Ben is sad.
But he fixes it.

Another drone crashes.
A sensor breaks.
Ben works all night.

Ben fixes both drones.
He has extra parts.
He is very smart.

The competition day comes.
Ben's drone flies very well.
It is the best!

Ben and Tim win!
They win the competition!
They are very happy.

Ben thinks about his life.
He was an art student.
Now he builds drones.

Ben smiles.
Tim smiles.
They did it!
