# A New Chapter: Barcelona

After Colombia, I flew to Barcelona. Tim went back to Europe. I started my new life.

Barcelona was my plan for a long time. Tim and I applied to a master's program at UPC. We got accepted.

I moved into a new apartment. The city was exciting.

Every day I explored. I saw the old streets of the Gothic Quarter. I went to the beaches. I saw mountains in the distance. I wanted to snowboard there.

The master's program was okay. Some professors were good. Some were not. The theory was dry.

But the city was great. I heard Spanish and Catalan in the streets. I wanted to learn more.

My Spanish is good now. But not good enough. I still miss some words.

One evening, I did not study. I started building something. A website. I called it VIA Fabula.

VIA Fabula means "Language Learning Through Stories." It helps me learn Spanish. I can read stories at different levels. I can switch between languages.

I needed stories for the website. So I wrote this book. It is my own story.

The art kid from Hamburg made a web app. That is amazing.

I think about my journey. Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt. Then London and Alabama. Then Colombia. Now Barcelona.

I don't know everything yet. That's okay. The path shows itself as I walk.

And somewhere, mountains are waiting for me. But first, I finish this chapter. In Spanish.
