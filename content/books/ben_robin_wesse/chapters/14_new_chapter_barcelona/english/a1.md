# A New Chapter: Barcelona

After Colombia, I flew to Barcelona. Tim went back to Europe. I started my new life.

Barcelona was my plan for a long time. Tim and I applied to a master's program at UPC. We got accepted.

I moved into a new apartment. The city was exciting.

Every day I explored. I saw the old streets of the Gothic Quarter. I went to the beaches. I saw mountains in the distance. I wanted to snowboard there.

The master's program was okay. Some professors were good. Some were not. The theory was dry.

But the city was great. I heard Spanish and Catalan in the streets. I wanted to learn more.

My Spanish is good now. But not good enough. I still miss some words. That's why I built this website. It helps me learn Spanish better.

I think about my journey. Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt. Then London and Alabama. Then Colombia. Now Barcelona.

The art kid from Hamburg became a drone engineer. Strange but true.

I don't know everything yet. That's okay. The path shows itself as I walk.

And somewhere, mountains are waiting for me to snowboard.
