# A New Chapter: Barcelona

After Colombia, I flew directly to Barcelona. Tim headed back to Europe to start his next adventure, and I moved into my new apartment and started a new life.

Barcelona had been on my mind since before Huntsville. Tim and I had applied to the master's program in Automation, Control and Robotics at UPC—the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. We'd been accepted. The drone project had kept me in Klagenfurt for an extra year instead of doing Erasmus there, but now the city had finally waited for me.

The first months were overwhelming in the best way. Every day brought something new to explore—the Gothic Quarter with its narrow medieval streets, the beaches stretching along the Mediterranean, the mountains just visible in the distance, promising future snowboarding adventures.

The master's program was fine. Some professors were brilliant, others not so much. The theory was dry, as theory always is. But the city itself was the education I hadn't known I needed.

There's something about Barcelona that makes you want to learn. Maybe it's hearing Spanish and Catalan mixing in the streets, making you realize how much you still don't understand. Maybe it's the internationality of it all—students from everywhere, speaking all kinds of languages, creating a constant reminder that the world is bigger than your home country.

I'm writing this from my apartment, Spanish floating up from the street below. My Spanish is pretty good now, but not good enough. I still miss words, and I still struggle with the fast conversations of native speakers. That's why I built this website, actually—to help myself switch between language levels and see how sentences work in different languages.

Looking back at my journey—Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt to London to Alabama to Colombia to here—it doesn't feel real. The art kid who had no idea what to do with his life somehow became a drone engineer, a competition winner, and a master's student.

I still don't have everything figured out. But I've learned that's okay. The path reveals itself as you walk it.

And somewhere out there, there are mountains waiting to be snowboarded.
