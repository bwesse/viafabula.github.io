# A New Chapter: Barcelona

After Colombia, I flew directly to Barcelona. Tim headed back to Europe to start his next adventure, and I moved into my new apartment and started a new life.

Barcelona had been on my mind since before Huntsville. Tim and I had applied to the master's program in Automation, Control and Robotics at UPC—the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. We'd been accepted. The drone project had kept me in Klagenfurt for an extra year instead of doing Erasmus there, but now the city had finally waited for me.

The first months were overwhelming in the best way. Every day brought something new to explore—the Gothic Quarter with its narrow medieval streets, the beaches stretching along the Mediterranean, the mountains just visible in the distance, promising future snowboarding adventures.

The master's program was fine. Some professors were brilliant, others not so much. The theory was dry, as theory always is. But the city itself was the education I hadn't known I needed.

There's something about Barcelona that makes you want to learn. Maybe it's hearing Spanish and Catalan mixing in the streets, making you realize how much you still don't understand. Maybe it's the internationality of it all—students from everywhere, speaking all kinds of languages, creating a constant reminder that the world is bigger than your home country.

I'm writing this from my apartment, Spanish floating up from the street below. My Spanish is pretty good now, but not good enough. I still miss words, and I still struggle with the fast conversations of native speakers.

That frustration became inspiration. One evening, instead of studying, I found myself procrastinating—but for once, it was productive. I started building something. A website. A tool that would let me read stories at different language levels, switch between them instantly, see how the same sentences work in Spanish, English, German.

I called it VIA Fabula—Language Learning Through Stories.

The idea was simple: take a story, write it at every CEFR level from A0 to C2, translate it perfectly sentence-by-sentence across multiple languages. That way, if I didn't understand something in Spanish at the native level, I could drop down to B2, or B1, or even A0 if I needed to. I could see how the sentence was built, learn the vocabulary in context, then work my way back up.

As I built the app, I realized I needed stories to fill it. And what better story than my own? So I wrote this book—the journey from Hamburg to here, from art student to drone engineer to master's student in Barcelona. Every chapter, every adventure, every crash and every victory, translated and adapted for every level.

The art student who once thought he couldn't do technical things had built a web app. The kid who was unsure about everything had created something to help himself—and maybe others—learn.

Looking back at my journey—Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt to London to Alabama to Colombia to here—it doesn't feel real. But here I am, reading my own story in Spanish, switching to German when I want to remember where I came from, dropping to A1 when the subjunctive gets confusing.

I still don't have everything figured out. But I've learned that's okay. The path reveals itself as you walk it. Sometimes that path leads you to build something you never imagined—like an app, like a book about your own life, like a dream fulfilled.

And somewhere out there, there are mountains waiting to be snowboarded. But first, let me finish this chapter. In Spanish.
