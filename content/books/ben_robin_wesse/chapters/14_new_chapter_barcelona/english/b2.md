# A New Chapter: Barcelona

After Colombia, I flew directly to Barcelona while Tim headed back to Europe. New apartment, new city, new life—the phrase sounds cliché, but it genuinely captured how everything felt.

Barcelona had occupied my thoughts since before Huntsville. Tim and I had applied to the master's program in Automation, Control and Robotics at UPC—the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. We'd been accepted. While the drone project had anchored me in Klagenfurt for an additional year instead of pursuing an Erasmus exchange, the city had patiently awaited my arrival.

The initial months proved overwhelming in the most wonderful sense. Each day unveiled something new to explore—the Gothic Quarter with its labyrinthine medieval passages, the beaches extending along the Mediterranean coastline, the mountains hovering on the horizon, promising future snowboarding expeditions.

The master's program was acceptable enough. Some professors demonstrated genuine brilliance, others considerably less so. The theoretical coursework was predictably arid. But the city itself constituted the education I hadn't realized I required.

There's something peculiar about Barcelona that ignites a desire to learn. Perhaps it's the sound of Spanish and Catalan interweaving in the streets, making you acutely aware of how much comprehension still eludes you. Perhaps it's the sheer internationality of the place—students converging from every conceivable origin, speaking everything imaginable, creating an perpetual reminder that the world extends far beyond one's homeland.

I'm composing these words from my apartment, Spanish conversations drifting up from the street below. My Spanish has become reasonably proficient, but insufficiently so. I still miss words, still grapple with the rapid-fire exchanges of native speakers. That's precisely why I constructed this website—to facilitate my own transitions between language proficiency levels, to observe how identical sentences function across different languages.

Reflecting upon the journey—Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt to London to Alabama to Colombia to Barcelona—it scarcely feels authentic. The art student who possessed no notion of his future direction somehow metamorphosed into a drone engineer, a competition champion, a master's student in robotics.

I still haven't resolved everything. But I've discovered that's perfectly acceptable. The path illuminates itself as one traverses it.

And somewhere beyond the horizon, mountains await their snowboarder.
