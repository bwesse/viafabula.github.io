# A New Chapter: Barcelona

After Colombia, I flew directly to Barcelona while Tim headed back to Europe. New apartment, new city, new life—the phrase sounds cliché, but it genuinely captured how everything felt.

Barcelona had occupied my thoughts since before Huntsville. Tim and I had applied to the master's program in Automation, Control and Robotics at UPC—the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. We'd been accepted. While the drone project had anchored me in Klagenfurt for an additional year instead of pursuing an Erasmus exchange, the city had patiently awaited my arrival.

The initial months proved overwhelming in the most wonderful sense. Each day unveiled something new to explore—the Gothic Quarter with its labyrinthine medieval passages, the beaches extending along the Mediterranean coastline, the mountains hovering on the horizon, promising future snowboarding expeditions.

The master's program was acceptable enough. Some professors demonstrated genuine brilliance, others considerably less so. The theoretical coursework was predictably arid. But the city itself constituted the education I hadn't realized I required.

There's something peculiar about Barcelona that ignites a desire to learn. Perhaps it's the sound of Spanish and Catalan interweaving in the streets, making you acutely aware of how much comprehension still eludes you. Perhaps it's the sheer internationality of the place—students converging from every conceivable origin, speaking everything imaginable, creating an perpetual reminder that the world extends far beyond one's homeland.

I'm composing these words from my apartment, Spanish conversations drifting up from the street below. My Spanish has become reasonably proficient, but insufficiently so. I still miss words, still grapple with the rapid-fire exchanges of native speakers.

That frustration evolved into inspiration. One evening, rather than studying, I found myself procrastinating—though for once, it proved productive. I commenced building something. A website. A tool that would enable me to read stories at varying language proficiency levels, transitioning between them instantaneously, observing how identical sentences function in Spanish, English, German.

I designated it VIA Fabula—Language Learning Through Stories.

The concept was straightforward: select a narrative, compose it at every CEFR tier from A0 to C2, translate it flawlessly sentence-by-sentence across multiple languages. Consequently, if something at native Spanish level eluded my comprehension, I could descend to B2, or B1, or even A0 if necessary. I could observe sentence construction, acquire vocabulary contextually, then gradually ascend again.

As I developed the application, I recognized the necessity for narratives to populate it. What superior subject than my own experiences? Thus I authored this book—the odyssey from Hamburg to here, from art student to drone engineer to master's candidate in Barcelona. Every chapter, every adventure, every collision and triumph, translated and adapted for each proficiency tier.

The art student who once believed himself incapable of technical endeavors had constructed a web application. The youth uncertain about everything had created something to assist himself—and perhaps others—in learning.

Reflecting upon the journey—Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt to London to Alabama to Colombia to Barcelona—it scarcely feels authentic. Yet here I am, perusing my own narrative in Spanish, transitioning to German when nostalgia beckons, descending to A1 when the subjunctive proves bewildering.

I still haven't resolved everything. But I've discovered that's perfectly acceptable. The path illuminates itself as one traverses it. Occasionally that path leads one to construct something previously unimagined—an application, a book chronicling one's own existence, a dream actualized.

And somewhere beyond the horizon, mountains await their snowboarder. But first, permit me to conclude this chapter. In Spanish.
