# A New Chapter: Barcelona

After Colombia, I flew directly to Barcelona. Tim went back to Europe. I moved into my new apartment and started a new life.

Barcelona had been on my mind for a long time. Tim and I had applied to the master's program in Automation, Control and Robotics at UPC. We were accepted. The drone project had kept me in Klagenfurt for an extra year instead of doing Erasmus there, but now the city was finally waiting for me.

The first months were exciting in the best way. Every day I found something new to explore. I walked through the Gothic Quarter with its narrow old streets. I went to the beaches along the Mediterranean. I saw the mountains in the distance and thought about snowboarding there.

The master's program was okay. Some professors were very good, and others were not. The theory was dry, like theory always is. But the city itself was an education I did not know I needed.

There is something about Barcelona that makes you want to learn. You hear Spanish and Catalan in the streets, and you understand how much you still do not know. Students come from everywhere, and they speak many different languages. It reminds you that the world is bigger than your home country.

I am writing this from my apartment. I can hear Spanish from the street below. My Spanish is pretty good now, but it is not good enough. I still miss words, and I still have problems with fast conversations.

That frustration became inspiration. One evening, instead of studying, I started building something. A website. I called it VIA Fabula—Language Learning Through Stories.

The idea was simple. I take a story and write it at every language level from A0 to C2. Then I translate it into different languages. If I do not understand something in Spanish, I can go down to an easier level. I can see how the sentence is built and learn the vocabulary.

I needed stories for the website. What better story than my own? So I wrote this book—my journey from Hamburg to here. Every chapter, every adventure, translated and adapted for every level.

The art kid who did not know what to do with his life made a web application. He wrote a book about his own life.

When I look back at my journey—Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt to London to Alabama to Colombia to here—it does not feel real. But here I am, reading my own story in Spanish.

I still do not have everything figured out. But that is okay. The path shows itself as you walk it. Sometimes that path leads you to build something you never imagined—like an app, like a book about your life.

And somewhere out there, mountains are waiting for me. But first, let me finish this chapter. In Spanish.
