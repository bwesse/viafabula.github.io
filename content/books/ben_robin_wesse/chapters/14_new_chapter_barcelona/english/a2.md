# A New Chapter: Barcelona

After Colombia, I flew directly to Barcelona. Tim went back to Europe. I moved into my new apartment and started a new life.

Barcelona had been on my mind for a long time. Tim and I had applied to the master's program in Automation, Control and Robotics at UPC. We were accepted. The drone project had kept me in Klagenfurt for an extra year instead of doing Erasmus there, but now the city was finally waiting for me.

The first months were exciting in the best way. Every day I found something new to explore. I walked through the Gothic Quarter with its narrow old streets. I went to the beaches along the Mediterranean. I saw the mountains in the distance and thought about snowboarding there.

The master's program was okay. Some professors were very good, and others were not. The theory was dry, like theory always is. But the city itself was an education I did not know I needed.

There is something about Barcelona that makes you want to learn. You hear Spanish and Catalan in the streets, and you understand how much you still do not know. Students come from everywhere, and they speak many different languages. It reminds you that the world is bigger than your home country.

I am writing this from my apartment. I can hear Spanish from the street below. My Spanish is pretty good now, but it is not good enough. I still miss words, and I still have problems with fast conversations. That is why I built this website. It helps me switch between language levels and see how sentences work in different languages.

When I look back at my journey—Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt to London to Alabama to Colombia to here—it does not feel real. The art kid who did not know what to do with his life somehow became a drone engineer and a competition winner.

I still do not have everything figured out. But that is okay. The path shows itself as you walk it.

And somewhere out there, mountains are waiting for me to snowboard.
