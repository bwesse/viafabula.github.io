# A New Chapter: Barcelona

So after Colombia, I just flew straight to Barcelona. Tim headed back to Europe, and I... started over, I guess? New apartment, new city, whole new life.

Barcelona had been in my head forever, honestly. Tim and I had applied to the master's program at UPC—Automation, Control and Robotics. We got in. The drone project had kept me stuck in Klagenfurt for an extra year instead of doing Erasmus there, but finally the city was ready for me.

The first few months were just... a lot. In the best way. Every day there's something new—the Gothic Quarter with its maze of old streets, beaches right there on the Mediterranean, mountains in the distance just begging for a snowboard.

The master's program is whatever. Some profs are great, others kinda suck. Theory's dry, like theory always is. But the city? The city's teaching me things I didn't know I needed to learn.

There's something about this place that makes you want to get better. Maybe it's hearing Spanish and Catalan all mixed together in the streets, constantly reminding you how much you still don't get. Students from literally everywhere, speaking like a hundred different languages. Makes you realize the world's way bigger than wherever you came from.

I'm writing this from my apartment right now, Spanish floating up from the street. My Spanish is decent—but not good enough. I still miss words, still get lost when people talk too fast.

That frustration became inspiration though. One night, instead of studying, I started procrastinating—but like, productive procrastination for once. I started building something. A website. A tool that'd let me read stories at different language levels, switch between them instantly, see how the same sentences work in Spanish, English, German.

I called it VIA Fabula—Language Learning Through Stories.

The idea was simple: take a story, write it at every CEFR level from A0 to C2, translate it perfectly sentence-by-sentence across multiple languages. That way, if I don't understand something in Spanish at native level, I can drop down to B2, or B1, or even A0 if I need to. See how the sentence is built, learn the vocab in context, then work my way back up.

As I built the app, I realized I needed stories to fill it. And what better story than my own? So I wrote this book—the journey from Hamburg to here, from art student to drone engineer to master's student in Barcelona. Every chapter, every adventure, every crash and every win, translated and adapted for every level.

The art kid who once thought he couldn't do technical stuff had built a web app. The kid who was unsure about everything had created something to help himself—and maybe others—learn.

Looking back at everything—Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt to London to Alabama to Colombia to here—it doesn't even feel real. But here I am, reading my own story in Spanish, switching to German when I wanna remember where I came from, dropping to A1 when the subjunctive gets confusing.

Still don't have it all figured out. But turns out that's okay. The path shows up as you walk it. Sometimes that path leads you to build something you never imagined—like an app, like a book about your own life, like a dream coming true.

And somewhere out there, there are mountains waiting for me to shred. But first, let me finish this chapter. In Spanish.
