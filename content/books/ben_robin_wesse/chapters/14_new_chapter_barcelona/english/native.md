# A New Chapter: Barcelona

So after Colombia, I just flew straight to Barcelona. Tim headed back to Europe, and I... started over, I guess? New apartment, new city, whole new life.

Barcelona had been in my head forever, honestly. Tim and I had applied to the master's program at UPC—Automation, Control and Robotics. We got in. The drone project had kept me stuck in Klagenfurt for an extra year instead of doing Erasmus there, but finally the city was ready for me.

The first few months were just... a lot. In the best way. Every day there's something new—the Gothic Quarter with its maze of old streets, beaches right there on the Mediterranean, mountains in the distance just begging for a snowboard.

The master's program is whatever. Some profs are great, others kinda suck. Theory's dry, like theory always is. But the city? The city's teaching me things I didn't know I needed to learn.

There's something about this place that makes you want to get better. Maybe it's hearing Spanish and Catalan all mixed together in the streets, constantly reminding you how much you still don't get. Students from literally everywhere, speaking like a hundred different languages. Makes you realize the world's way bigger than wherever you came from.

I'm writing this from my apartment right now, Spanish floating up from the street. My Spanish is decent—but not good enough. I still miss words, still get lost when people talk too fast. That's basically why I built this website. Helps me switch between language levels, see how sentences work across different languages.

Looking back at everything—Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt to London to Alabama to Colombia to here—it doesn't even feel real. The art kid who had zero clue what to do with his life somehow ended up as a drone engineer, competition winner, master's student.

Still don't have it all figured out. But turns out that's okay. The path shows up as you walk it, or whatever.

And somewhere out there, there are mountains waiting for me to shred.
