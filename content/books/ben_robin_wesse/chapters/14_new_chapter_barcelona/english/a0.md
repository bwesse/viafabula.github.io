# A New Chapter: Barcelona

Colombia was fun. We wrote our theses there.

Now I am in Barcelona. It is a new city. It is a new life.

I study at UPC. It is a master's program. I learn about robots.

Barcelona is beautiful. There are beaches. There are old streets.

My Spanish is good but not great. I still learn every day.

I made this website. It helps me learn Spanish.

I think about my journey. Hamburg. Canada. Peru. Klagenfurt. Now Barcelona.

I was an art student. Now I build drones. Now I study more.

I do not know everything. That is okay.

There are mountains nearby. I want to snowboard again.
