# A New Chapter: Barcelona

Colombia was fun. We wrote our theses there.

Now I am in Barcelona. It is a new city. It is a new life.

I study at UPC. It is a master's program. I learn about robots.

Barcelona is beautiful. There are beaches. There are old streets.

My Spanish is good but not great. I still learn every day.

I wanted to learn better. I made a website. It is called VIA Fabula.

VIA Fabula helps me read stories. I can read them at different levels. I can switch between Spanish, English, and German.

I wrote this book for the website. It is my story.

The art student made a web app. That is amazing.

I think about my journey. Hamburg. Canada. Peru. Klagenfurt. Now Barcelona.

I was an art student. Now I build drones. Now I study more. Now I make websites.

I do not know everything. That is okay. The path shows itself.

There are mountains nearby. I want to snowboard again. But first, I finish this chapter. In Spanish.
