# A New Chapter: Barcelona

Post-Colombia, I embarked upon a direct aerial trajectory to Barcelona whilst Tim commenced his repatriation to the European continent. A novel domicile, an unfamiliar metropolis, an entirely reconstituted existential framework—the phraseology may appear irredeemably hackneyed, yet it authentically encapsulated the profoundly metamorphic nature of those inaugural weeks in Catalonia.

Barcelona had occupied the chambers of my contemplation since well before our Huntsville triumph. Tim and I had submitted applications to the postgraduate programme in Automation, Control and Robotics at UPC—the venerable Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Our candidatures had been favourably adjudicated. While the drone project had anchored my physical presence in Klagenfurt for a supplementary annum in lieu of pursuing an Erasmus exchange, the Catalan capital had maintained its patient vigil, awaiting my eventual manifestation within its storied boundaries.

The inaugural months proved overwhelmingly gratifying in the most salubrious and edifying sense conceivable. Each diurnal cycle unveiled novel territories demanding thoroughgoing exploration—the Gothic Quarter with its labyrinthine medieval arteries redolent of centuries past, the littoral expanses stretching languidly along the Mediterranean coastline, the mountains materializing ethereally upon the distant horizon, promising future expeditions upon snow-mantled slopes.

The master's programme demonstrated adequate scholastic merit in its pedagogical offerings. Certain professorial figures evinced genuine intellectual brilliance of the highest calibre; others manifested considerably diminished competence in their craft. The theoretical coursework was predictably desiccated, as theoretical material invariably tends to be. However, the city itself constituted the education I had not previously recognized as requisite for my continued development.

There exists something ineffably singular about Barcelona that ignites an ardent desire for the acquisition of knowledge in all its multitudinous forms. Perhaps it manifests in the acoustic interweaving of Spanish and Catalan permeating the thoroughfares, rendering one acutely cognizant of the vast comprehension that continues to elude one's linguistic grasp. Perhaps it resides in the sheer cosmopolitanism of the milieu—scholars converging from every conceivable geographical provenance, articulating themselves in innumerable tongues, perpetually reminding one that the world extends immeasurably beyond one's native boundaries.

I am presently composing these reflections from my apartment, Spanish discourse ascending from the street below like an auditory tapestry. My facility with the language has attained reasonable proficiency, yet remains insufficiently developed for complete personal satisfaction. Lexical items continue to evade my comprehension; the rapid-fire exchanges of native interlocutors still present formidable challenges to understanding.

This linguistic deficiency, rather than precipitating despondency, transmuted into inspiration of the most unexpected variety. One evening, eschewing scholastic pursuits in favour of procrastination, I discovered myself engaged in an unexpectedly productive endeavour. I commenced constructing something. A digital platform of considerable ambition. A tool that would enable me to peruse narratives at varying linguistic proficiency tiers, transitioning between them instantaneously, observing how identical propositions manifest themselves in Spanish, English, German.

I designated it VIA Fabula—Language Learning Through Stories.

The conceptual architecture was elegantly straightforward in its design: select a narrative, compose it at every CEFR proficiency tier from the rudimentary A0 to the masterful C2, translate it with meticulous fidelity sentence-by-sentence across multiple linguistic domains. Consequently, should something at native Spanish proficiency elude my comprehension, I could descend to B2, or B1, or even A0 if circumstances so required. I could observe the architectural construction of sentences, acquire vocabulary contextually embedded within meaningful discourse, then gradually ascend the proficiency ladder once more toward mastery.

As I developed the application with increasing devotion, I recognized the necessity for substantive narratives to populate its digital chambers. What superior subject matter than my own experiential trajectory through this extraordinary existence? Thus I authored this very book—the odyssey from Hamburg to here, from artistically-inclined student to drone engineer to master's candidate in Barcelona. Every chapter chronicling adventure, every catastrophic collision and triumphant victory meticulously translated and adapted for each proficiency tier.

The artistically-inclined youth who once believed himself constitutionally incapable of technical endeavours had constructed a web application of genuine utility. The youth uncertain about virtually everything existential had created something to assist himself—and perhaps others—in the noble acquisition of linguistic knowledge.

Retrospectively contemplating the trajectory—Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt to London to Alabama to Colombia to Barcelona—the narrative scarcely assumes the character of verifiable, lived reality. Yet here I find myself, perusing my own narrative in Spanish, transitioning to German when nostalgic sentiment beckons, descending to A1 when the subjunctive mood proves bewildering to comprehension.

I have not yet attained comprehensive resolution of all existential inquiries. However, I have discovered that such philosophical incompleteness is entirely acceptable, even perhaps desirable. The path illuminates itself progressively, revelatorily, as one traverses its meandering length. Occasionally that path leads one to construct something previously unimagined—an application, a book chronicling one's own existence, a dream actualized in digital form.

And somewhere beyond the visible horizon, mountains await their devoted snowboarder with infinite patience. But first, permit me to conclude this chapter. In Spanish.
