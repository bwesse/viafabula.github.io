# A New Chapter: Barcelona

Post-Colombia, I embarked upon a direct trajectory to Barcelona whilst Tim commenced his return to Europe. A novel domicile, an unfamiliar metropolis, an entirely reconstituted existence—the phraseology may appear hackneyed, yet it authentically encapsulated the metamorphic nature of those initial weeks.

Barcelona had occupied my contemplations since well before Huntsville. Tim and I had submitted applications to the master's programme in Automation, Control and Robotics at UPC—the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Our candidatures had been favourably received. While the drone project had anchored me in Klagenfurt for an supplementary annum in lieu of pursuing an Erasmus exchange, the Catalan capital had maintained its patient vigil for my eventual arrival.

The inaugural months proved overwhelmingly gratifying in the most salubrious sense. Each diurnal cycle unveiled novel territories demanding exploration—the Gothic Quarter with its labyrinthine medieval arteries, the littoral expanses stretching languidly along the Mediterranean coastline, the mountains materializing on the distant horizon, promising future expeditions upon snow-covered slopes.

The master's programme demonstrated adequate scholastic merit. Certain professorial figures evinced genuine intellectual brilliance; others manifested considerably diminished pedagogical competence. The theoretical coursework was predictably desiccated, as theoretical material tends to be. However, the city itself constituted the education I had not previously recognized as requisite.

There exists something ineffably singular about Barcelona that ignites an ardent desire for acquisition of knowledge. Perhaps it manifests in the acoustic interweaving of Spanish and Catalan permeating the thoroughfares, rendering one acutely cognizant of the vast comprehension that continues to elude one's grasp. Perhaps it resides in the sheer cosmopolitanism of the milieu—scholars converging from every conceivable geographical origin, articulating themselves in innumerable tongues, perpetually reminding one that the world extends immeasurably beyond one's native boundaries.

I am presently composing these reflections from my apartment, Spanish discourse ascending from the street below. My facility with the language has attained reasonable proficiency, yet remains insufficiently developed for complete satisfaction. Lexical items continue to evade my comprehension; the rapid-fire exchanges of native speakers still present formidable challenges.

That frustration evolved into inspiration of an unexpected variety. One evening, rather than engaging in scholastic pursuits, I found myself procrastinating—though for once, it manifested as productive procrastination. I commenced constructing something. A digital platform. A tool that would enable me to peruse narratives at varying linguistic proficiency levels, transitioning between them instantaneously, observing how identical propositions function in Spanish, English, German.

I designated it VIA Fabula—Language Learning Through Stories.

The concept was elegantly straightforward: select a narrative, compose it at every CEFR proficiency tier from A0 to C2, translate it flawlessly sentence-by-sentence across multiple languages. Consequently, should something at native Spanish level elude my comprehension, I could descend to B2, or B1, or even A0 if circumstances required. I could observe sentence construction, acquire vocabulary contextually, then gradually ascend the proficiency ladder once more.

As I developed the application, I recognized the necessity for substantive narratives to populate it. What superior subject matter than my own experiential trajectory? Thus I authored this book—the odyssey from Hamburg to here, from art student to drone engineer to master's candidate in Barcelona. Every chapter, every adventure, every catastrophic collision and triumphant victory, translated and adapted for each proficiency tier.

The artistically-inclined youth who once believed himself constitutionally incapable of technical endeavors had constructed a web application. The youth uncertain about virtually everything had created something to assist himself—and perhaps others—in the acquisition of linguistic knowledge.

Retrospectively contemplating the trajectory—Hamburg to Canada to Peru to Klagenfurt to London to Alabama to Colombia to Barcelona—the narrative scarcely assumes the character of verifiable reality. Yet here I am, perusing my own narrative in Spanish, transitioning to German when nostalgia beckons, descending to A1 when the subjunctive proves bewildering.

I have not yet attained comprehensive resolution of all existential questions. However, I have discovered that such incompleteness is entirely acceptable. The path illuminates itself progressively as one traverses its length. Occasionally that path leads one to construct something previously unimagined—an application, a book chronicling one's own existence, a dream actualized.

And somewhere beyond the visible horizon, mountains await their devoted snowboarder. But first, permit me to conclude this chapter. In Spanish.
