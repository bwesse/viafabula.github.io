# Sapience Begins

Professor Weis mentioned it casually during a Communication Systems Engineering lecture. "There's a student project involving drones. Search and rescue operations. It's an international competition. Anyone interested can apply."

I looked at Tim across the lecture hall. Tim looked back at me. Without saying a word, we both knew we were going to apply.

Neither of us had any drone experience whatsoever. I had never built a drone, flown a drone, or even held a drone controller in my hands. But the project sounded incredible: build autonomous flying robots capable of searching for and rescuing people in disaster scenarios. Real-world impact. Real engineering challenges.

We wrote our applications that same night. We were completely honest: we had enthusiasm, we had time, and we were willing to learn everything from scratch. We didn't mention that I had studied art in high school or that neither of us had touched robotics before arriving in Klagenfurt.

Two weeks later, we received the email. We were in.

SAPIENCE—that was the name of the project. It was funded by NATO, in cooperation with University of Delft, City University London, and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The competition would happen in stages: first London, then Huntsville. The timeline was tight, and the expectations were high.

And suddenly, Tim and I found ourselves as drone builders.

The learning curve was incredibly steep. CAD software, flight controllers, motor specifications, battery management, sensor integration—every day brought new concepts that we had to master. We made mistakes constantly. Our early prototypes crashed spectacularly. But with each crash, we learned something new.

The team office became our second home. Late nights regularly turned into early mornings. Pizza boxes accumulated in the corners. Code was written, rewritten, and thrown away. Parts were ordered, assembled, broken, and rebuilt.

We were building three heavy-lift drones for the London competition: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix. Each one was a monster of carbon fiber and technology, capable of carrying cameras, sensors, and payload. Each one represented hundreds of hours of dedicated work.

I discovered my role within the team: 3D design and physical construction. My art background, which I had initially thought was completely irrelevant, actually turned out to be useful. Understanding form, visualizing structures, thinking in three dimensions—these skills transferred surprisingly well to drone design.

For the first time since arriving in Klagenfurt, I genuinely felt like I was in exactly the right place.
