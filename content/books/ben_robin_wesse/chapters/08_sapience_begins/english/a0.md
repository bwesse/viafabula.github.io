# Sapience Begins

The professor talks about drones. He says there is a project.

Tim and I want to join. We have no experience with drones. Zero.

We write our applications. Two weeks later, we get in.

The project is called SAPIENCE. It is about search and rescue drones.

We learn many new things. CAD software. Motors. Batteries.

We make mistakes. Our drones crash. But we learn.

We build three drones: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix.

I do 3D design. My art skills help me. I can see shapes well.

I like this work. I am in the right place.
