# Sapience Begins

Professor Weis mentioned it during a lecture: "There's a student project with drones. Search and rescue. Anyone interested can apply."

Tim and I looked at each other. We knew we were going to apply.

Neither of us had any drone experience. I had never built or flown a drone before. But the project sounded incredible: build autonomous robots that could help rescue people in disasters.

We wrote our applications that night. We were honest: we had enthusiasm and time, and we were ready to learn from scratch. We didn't mention my art background.

Two weeks later, we got the email. We were in.

SAPIENCE—that was the project name. Funded by NATO, together with University of Delft, City University London, and University of Alabama in Huntsville. First competition in London, then Huntsville.

And suddenly, Tim and I were drone builders.

The learning was intense. CAD software, flight controllers, motors, batteries, sensors—every day we learned something new. We crashed drones constantly. But each crash taught us something.

The team office became our second home. Late nights became early mornings. Pizza boxes piled up. Code was written and rewritten.

We built three heavy drones for London: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix. Each one was a big machine of carbon fiber and technology.

I found my role: 3D design and construction. My art skills, which I thought were useless, actually helped. Understanding shapes and thinking in three dimensions worked well for drone design.

For the first time since arriving in Klagenfurt, I felt like I was where I should be.
