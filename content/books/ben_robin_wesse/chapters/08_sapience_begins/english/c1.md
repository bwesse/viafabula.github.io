# Sapience Begins

Professor Weis alluded to it with deliberate casualness during a Communication Systems Engineering lecture—a strategic understatement that belied its significance. "There exists a student project involving unmanned aerial systems—search and rescue applications. An international competition framework. Those harbouring interest may submit applications."

My gaze instinctively sought Tim's across the amphitheatre of the lecture hall. Without the necessity of verbal exchange, mutual recognition crystallised instantaneously. We would apply. The decision admitted no deliberation.

Neither of us possessed the slightest vestige of drone expertise. The absence was absolute and unqualified. I had never constructed, operated, or even manipulated the controls of an unmanned aerial vehicle. Yet the project's prospectus captivated our collective imagination: engineering autonomous airborne platforms capable of conducting search operations and executing extractions in catastrophic scenarios. Tangible humanitarian impact. Genuine engineering exigencies.

We drafted our submissions that very evening with scrupulous attention. Our approach remained characterised by transparent honesty: we possessed enthusiasm in abundance, temporal resources to dedicate, and demonstrated unwavering commitment to acquiring every requisite competency ab initio. We exercised judicious discretion in omitting certain particulars—specifically, that my Abitur concentration had been the fine arts, or that neither of us had encountered the robotics discipline prior to matriculating at Klagenfurt.

A fortnight hence, the correspondence of acceptance materialised in our inboxes. We had secured admission.

SAPIENCE—thus was the venture denominated. It operated under the aegis of NATO funding, in collaborative partnership with the University of Delft, City University London, and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The competitive framework would unfold in sequential phases: the London engagement preceding the Huntsville culmination. The chronological constraints were exacting. The performance expectations, proportionately elevated.

And thus, without preamble or transition, Tim and I had transmuted into aerospace engineers of sorts.

The pedagogical trajectory approached verticality. Computer-aided design platforms, flight control architectures, motor specifications and tolerances, battery management systems, sensor integration protocols—each diurnal cycle introduced novel conceptual territories requiring systematic conquest. Our errors manifested with distressing frequency. Preliminary prototypes achieved spectacular failures, plummeting earthward with dispiriting regularity. Yet each catastrophic descent yielded instructive dividends.

The team workspace metamorphosed into our secondary domicile. Nocturnal sessions dissolved imperceptibly into matutinal hours. Pizza cartons accumulated in neglected peripheries. Code was composed, subjected to revision, and consigned to oblivion. Components were requisitioned, assembled, compromised, and reconstructed.

We were fabricating three heavy-lift aerial platforms for the London engagement: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix. Each constituted a formidable synthesis of carbon fiber composites and sophisticated technological systems, engineered to transport imaging equipment, sensory apparatus, and substantial payload. Each embodied hundreds of hours of meticulous, painstaking labour.

I excavated my particular niche within the team's organisational structure: three-dimensional design and physical fabrication. My artistic formation, which I had previously dismissed as manifestly irrelevant to technical endeavours, demonstrated unexpected utility. Comprehending morphological relationships, visualising structural articulations, conceptualising in spatial dimensions—these competencies effected surprisingly efficacious transfer to the domain of aerial vehicle architecture.

For the first time since establishing residence in Klagenfurt, I experienced the profound sensation of occupying precisely the correct coordinates of existence.
