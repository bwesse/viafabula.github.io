# Sapience Begins

Professor Weis talked about a drone project in class. Tim and I looked at each other. We wanted to join.

We had no drone experience. Zero. But the project sounded amazing: build drones to help rescue people.

We wrote our applications that night. Two weeks later, we got in.

The project was called SAPIENCE. It was funded by NATO. The competition was in London first, then Huntsville.

We learned very fast. CAD software. Flight controllers. Motors. Batteries. Sensors.

We made many mistakes. Our drones crashed often. But we learned from each crash.

The team office became our second home. We worked late nights. We ate pizza. We built and rebuilt.

We built three big drones: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix.

I did 3D design. My art background helped me. I could see shapes and structures well.

For the first time in Klagenfurt, I felt I was in the right place.
