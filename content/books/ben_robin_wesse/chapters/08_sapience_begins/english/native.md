# Sapience Begins

Professor Weis dropped it casually in lecture: "There's a drone project. Search and rescue. International competition. Apply if you're interested."

Tim and I locked eyes. No words needed—we were in.

Zero drone experience between us. None. Never built one, never flew one, never even touched a controller. But the pitch was irresistible: build flying robots to save people. Real impact. Real engineering.

We wrote applications that night. Honest ones: lots of enthusiasm, plenty of time, willing to learn from scratch. Didn't mention my art background or our complete lack of robotics experience.

Two weeks later: acceptance email. We were in.

SAPIENCE. NATO funding. Partner universities in Delft, London, and Huntsville. Competition phases: London first, then Alabama.

Suddenly we were drone engineers. Wild.

The learning curve was basically vertical. CAD, flight controllers, motors, batteries, sensors—new concepts every single day. Crashed drones constantly. Learned from every failure though.

The team office became home base. Late nights, early mornings, pizza boxes everywhere. Code written, rewritten, trashed. Parts ordered, built, broken, rebuilt.

Three heavy drones for London: Blackbird, Goldeneye, Phoenix. Monsters of carbon fiber. Hundreds of hours each.

Found my thing: 3D design and building. Turns out art actually helps—understanding shapes, seeing structures, thinking in three dimensions. Who knew.

First time in Klagenfurt I felt like I was exactly where I belonged.
