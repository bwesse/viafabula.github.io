# Sapience Begins

Professor Weis mentioned it casually in a Communication Systems Engineering lecture. "There's a student project with drones. Search and rescue. International competition. Anyone interested can apply."

I looked at Tim. Tim looked at me. We both knew we were going to apply.

Neither of us had any drone experience. Zero. I'd never built a drone, flown a drone, or even held a drone controller. But the project sounded incredible: build autonomous flying robots that could search for and rescue people in disaster scenarios. Real-world impact. Real engineering challenges.

We wrote our applications that night. We were honest: we had enthusiasm, we had time, and we were willing to learn everything from scratch. We didn't mention that I'd studied art in high school or that neither of us had touched robotics before Klagenfurt.

Two weeks later, we got the email. We were in.

SAPIENCE—that was the name of the project. Funded by NATO, in cooperation with University of Delft, City University London, and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The competition would happen in stages: first London, then Huntsville. The timeline was tight. The expectations were high.

And suddenly, Tim and I were drone builders.

The learning curve was vertical. CAD software, flight controllers, motor specifications, battery management, sensor integration—every day brought new concepts to master. We made mistakes constantly. Early prototypes crashed spectacularly. But with each crash, we learned something new.

The team office became our second home. Late nights turned into early mornings. Pizza boxes accumulated. Code was written, rewritten, and thrown away. Parts were ordered, assembled, broken, and rebuilt.

We were building three heavy-lift drones for the London competition: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix. Each one was a monster of carbon fiber and technology, capable of carrying cameras, sensors, and payload. Each one represented hundreds of hours of work.

I found my role in the team: 3D design and physical construction. My art background, which I'd thought irrelevant, turned out to be useful. Understanding form, visualizing structures, thinking in three dimensions—these skills transferred surprisingly well to drone design.

For the first time since arriving in Klagenfurt, I felt like I was in exactly the right place.
