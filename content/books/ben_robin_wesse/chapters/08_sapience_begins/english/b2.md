# Sapience Begins

Professor Weis mentioned it almost offhandedly during a Communication Systems Engineering lecture. "There's a student project involving drones—search and rescue operations. It's an international competition. Anyone interested is welcome to apply."

I caught Tim's eye across the lecture hall. Without exchanging a single word, we both recognised that we were going to submit applications. The decision was instantaneous and mutual.

Neither of us possessed any drone experience whatsoever. Absolutely none. I had never constructed, piloted, or so much as handled a drone controller. But the project description captivated us: building autonomous aerial vehicles capable of locating and extracting people from disaster scenarios. Genuine real-world impact. Authentic engineering challenges.

We composed our applications that very evening. We remained scrupulously honest: we possessed enthusiasm in abundance, we had time to dedicate, and we demonstrated willingness to acquire every skill from the ground up. We tactfully omitted mentioning that I had pursued art for my Abitur or that neither of us had encountered robotics prior to our arrival in Klagenfurt.

A fortnight later, the acceptance email arrived. We were in.

SAPIENCE—that was the project's designation. It operated under NATO funding, in collaboration with University of Delft, City University London, and the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The competition would proceed in phases: initially London, subsequently Huntsville. The schedule was demanding. The expectations were considerable.

And just like that, Tim and I had metamorphosed into drone engineers.

The learning trajectory was essentially vertical. CAD software, flight controllers, motor specifications, battery management protocols, sensor integration methodologies—each day introduced novel concepts requiring mastery. We committed errors with remarkable frequency. Our initial prototypes crashed with spectacular regularity. Yet each catastrophic failure imparted valuable lessons.

The team workspace evolved into our secondary residence. Late evenings seamlessly transitioned into early mornings. Pizza boxes accumulated in neglected corners. Code was composed, revised, and discarded. Components were procured, assembled, damaged, and reconstructed.

We were fabricating three heavy-lift platforms for the London competition: Blackbird, Goldeneye, and Phoenix. Each represented a formidable amalgamation of carbon fiber and advanced technology, capable of transporting cameras, sensors, and substantial payload. Each embodied hundreds of hours of meticulous labour.

I carved out my niche within the team: three-dimensional design and physical fabrication. My artistic background, which I had dismissed as irrelevant, proved unexpectedly advantageous. Comprehending form, visualising structural relationships, conceptualising in three dimensions—these competencies translated remarkably well to drone architecture.

For the first time since my arrival in Klagenfurt, I experienced the profound sensation of occupying precisely the right place.
