# Discovering Klagenfurt

How do you choose where to spend the next few years of your life?

That question consumed me after returning from Peru. I knew what I wanted to study—robotics and artificial intelligence—but that was only half the equation. The other half was figuring out where I actually wanted to be.

Hamburg friends assumed I'd stay local. German universities are solid, after all, and I wouldn't have to adapt to a new culture. But something in me resisted. I'd spent the past year proving to myself that I could thrive far from home. Going back to familiar surroundings felt like regression.

So I expanded my search. Austria, Switzerland, maybe even Spain or the Netherlands. I wanted somewhere with mountains, good weather, and a program worth attending. The intersection of that Venn diagram turned out to be smaller than I expected.

Klagenfurt emerged from the noise almost by accident. I was scrolling through Austrian universities when the name "Alpen-Adria Universität" caught my attention. Alps and Adriatic? That sounded promising.

I researched obsessively. Klagenfurt was the capital of Carinthia, Austria's southernmost province. It bordered Italy and Slovenia, creating a unique cultural blend of Germanic efficiency and Mediterranean warmth. The Wörthersee—one of Austria's largest lakes—sat practically in the city center. Ski resorts were within an hour's drive. And the university had a specific bachelor's program in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.

It felt too good to be true. So naturally, I assumed there must be a catch.

There wasn't. I applied, emphasizing my genuine interest and practical experience with robotics. My grades were inconsistent, but my passion was evident. When the acceptance came through, I felt something I hadn't expected: certainty. For the first time since starting the university search, I wasn't second-guessing myself.

Moving to Klagenfurt meant leaving Germany, leaving my family, leaving the only country I'd ever really known. But it also meant choosing my own path rather than defaulting to the easiest option. That felt important.

I packed my snowboard first. Non-negotiable. Whatever else happened in Klagenfurt, I was going to enjoy those mountains.

The day I arrived, the September sun was warming the lake to a temperature that practically demanded swimming. The Alps rose in the background like a promise. And I thought: okay. This might actually work.

I had no idea how right I was—or how much was about to change.
