# Discovering Klagenfurt

The question of where to study had haunted Ben throughout his Peruvian travels. He knew what he wanted: robotics, mountains, and a place worth living. Finding all three together seemed like asking for too much. Yet when he finally discovered Klagenfurt, it felt like the universe had been saving it for him.

The search process itself had been educational. Ben learned to navigate university websites in three languages, comparing program curricula and campus facilities across countries. German universities offered excellent technical education but mostly in industrial cities that offered little natural beauty. Swiss universities were beautiful but financially out of reach. Austrian institutions emerged as the sweet spot—German-language programs with Alpine access at reasonable costs.

The Alpen-Adria University in Klagenfurt stood out immediately. The program in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence matched Ben's interests perfectly. More importantly, the location offered everything he had been seeking: a large lake adjacent to the city, mountains within easy driving distance, and Italy just an hour to the south.

Ben applied with a mixture of hope and realism. His academic record was inconsistent—he was not a straight-A student—but his application letter conveyed genuine passion. When acceptance came, it felt like validation not just of his application but of the entire approach he had taken since graduating high school. The detours through Canada and Peru had not been wasted time; they had helped him identify exactly what he wanted.

Leaving Hamburg proved emotionally complicated. His parents were supportive but clearly worried about their son moving to a foreign country alone. Friends questioned why he would leave Germany for a small Austrian city most had never heard of. But Ben had learned in Peru to trust his instincts about place. Something about Klagenfurt felt right.

The drive south took nearly ten hours, crossing through the heart of Austria until the landscape shifted from rolling hills to proper Alpine territory. When Ben finally arrived in Klagenfurt, late summer sunlight was turning the Wörthersee into a sheet of gold. The mountains rose in the distance, promising winter adventures. And the university campus, compact but well-equipped, looked exactly like the kind of place where he could spend the next few years.

He unpacked his belongings that evening, starting with the most important item: his snowboard. If everything else failed, at least he would have the mountains.

But Ben had a feeling that failure wasn't in the cards. This felt like the beginning of something significant.
