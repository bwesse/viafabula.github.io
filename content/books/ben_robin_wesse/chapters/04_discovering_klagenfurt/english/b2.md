# Discovering Klagenfurt

The decision to attend university in Klagenfurt represented the convergence of multiple factors that Ben had been weighing throughout his months in Peru. Having decided that quality of life should be weighted alongside academic considerations, he needed to find a location that satisfied criteria most students would consider mutually exclusive: serious technical education in robotics, proximity to Alpine skiing, and an environment conducive to the kind of life he wanted to build.

The Alpen-Adria University emerged from Ben's exhaustive research as a surprisingly strong candidate. Though lacking the international prestige of larger institutions, it had developed specific competencies in emerging technology fields. The bachelor's program in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence combined theoretical foundations with practical application in ways that aligned with Ben's learning preferences. Faculty research interests suggested opportunities for hands-on project work that would be harder to access at larger universities.

Klagenfurt itself presented even more compelling attractions. Positioned at the southern tip of Austria, the city occupied a unique geographical and cultural position. The Wörthersee—a large, warm, surprisingly Mediterranean-feeling lake—bordered the urban area. The Alps rose within easy driving distance, offering winter sports access that Ben considered non-negotiable. And the Italian border lay just an hour south, promising weekend excursions to a wholly different cultural context.

The application process felt like a formality given how well the opportunity matched his requirements. Ben's grades were adequate rather than exceptional, but his application essay conveyed genuine enthusiasm and the kind of intellectual curiosity that admissions committees often value more than raw scores. When acceptance arrived, it confirmed what he had already begun to feel: this was the right place.

Preparations for the move triggered complex emotions. Hamburg had been home for Ben's entire life; Austria, though German-speaking, remained foreign territory. His parents expressed support undercut by obvious concern about their son's distance. Friends questioned the choice, wondering why he would leave Germany for a place they had never heard of. But Ben had learned through experience to trust his instincts about place. Something about Klagenfurt's combination of academic opportunity and lifestyle appeal felt fundamentally right.

The journey south crystallized the magnitude of the transition. As the landscape shifted from northern German flatness to Alpine drama, Ben felt the excitement of beginning something genuinely new. When he finally arrived in Klagenfurt, the September sun illuminating the Wörthersee in late-afternoon gold, the rightness of his choice became viscerally apparent.

He unpacked his snowboard first. Whatever else Klagenfurt offered or failed to offer, the mountains would be there. And Ben intended to make the most of them.
