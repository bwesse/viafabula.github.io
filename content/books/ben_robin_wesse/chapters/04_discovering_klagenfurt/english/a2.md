# Discovering Klagenfurt

The search for the right university consumed Ben for weeks after his return from Peru. He had crystallized his criteria during those months of wandering: he wanted a program in robotics or artificial intelligence, proximity to mountains for snowboarding, and a city small enough to feel manageable but interesting enough to keep him engaged. This combination proved surprisingly rare.

German universities offered strong technical programs, but most were located in industrial cities that offered little in terms of natural beauty. Swiss universities were excellent but expensive for foreign students. Austrian institutions emerged as a promising middle ground—German-language education with Alpine access at reasonable costs.

Klagenfurt appeared on his radar almost by accident. While scrolling through university rankings and program descriptions, he noticed the Alpen-Adria University's offering in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. The name alone suggested what he was hoping for: a place where academic rigor met outdoor adventure.

Further research confirmed his initial interest. Klagenfurt, the capital of Austria's Carinthia province, occupied a unique position at the crossroads of Central European cultures. Located in a valley surrounded by Alpine foothills, the city sat adjacent to Wörthersee—one of Austria's largest and warmest lakes. The Italian border lay just an hour's drive to the south; ski resorts dotted the mountains to the north.

The university itself, while not internationally famous, had developed specializations that aligned perfectly with Ben's interests. The robotics program emphasized practical application alongside theoretical foundations. Student testimonials spoke of a collaborative atmosphere and accessible faculty.

Ben applied with characteristic directness. His grades were not perfect—his inconsistent academic history remained visible—but his application letter conveyed genuine passion for the field and clarity about his goals. When the acceptance email arrived, he felt not just relief but rightness, as if pieces were finally falling into place.

Preparing to leave Hamburg for Austria brought a mixture of emotions. This was not temporary, like Canada or Peru. This was a choice of where to build the next phase of his life. He packed carefully, selecting what mattered: essential clothes, his laptop, and most importantly, his snowboard. If things didn't work out academically, he reasoned, at least he would have enjoyed the mountains.

The journey south felt like crossing into new territory—which, in every important sense, it was. Ben was leaving behind the familiar comfort of Hamburg for a city he had never visited, to pursue a program he had only read about online, among people he had never met. It was exactly the kind of leap that Peru had taught him he could handle.

Klagenfurt, when he finally arrived, exceeded expectations. The Wörthersee sparkled in late summer sunlight. The mountains rose green and promising on the horizon. And the university, modest in scale but modern in facilities, felt like a place where he could learn, grow, and maybe even thrive.

For the first time in years, Ben felt like he might be exactly where he was supposed to be.
