# Discovering Klagenfurt

I found Klagenfurt the way you find most important things in life: by accident, while looking for something else.

After Peru, I was back in Hamburg, tanned and slightly lost. I knew I wanted to study robotics. I knew I wanted mountains. I knew I wanted somewhere that felt worth living, not just worth attending. What I didn't know was whether such a place actually existed.

I spent weeks on my laptop, scrolling through university websites like a kid browsing a catalog. German universities? Good programs, grey cities. Swiss universities? Beautiful, but my bank account laughed at the tuition fees. Then I stumbled on Austria—specifically, on a small university in a small city called Klagenfurt.

The Alpen-Adria University. Even the name sounded promising. Alps and Adriatic? That suggested mountains and warmth, which was exactly what I was after.

I dug deeper. Klagenfurt sat at the southern tip of Austria, almost in Italy. There was a massive lake—Wörthersee—right next to the city. The Alps were close enough for day trips to ski resorts. And the university had a program in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence that looked genuinely interesting.

It felt almost suspicious, honestly. Where was the catch?

I applied. I got accepted. And I packed my bags with the same attitude I'd carried through Peru: if it doesn't work out, at least I'll have had fun. My snowboard came with me, of course. Non-negotiable.

The drive down from Hamburg took about ten hours. When I crossed into Austria and started seeing the mountains, something clicked. This was different. This felt right.

Klagenfurt itself was small—much smaller than Hamburg—but that was part of the appeal. The lake glittered in the September sunlight. The mountains rose in the distance like promises waiting to be kept. And the university campus, compact but modern, looked like somewhere I might actually enjoy spending time.

I remember thinking: this could work. This could really work.

I had no idea how right I was.
