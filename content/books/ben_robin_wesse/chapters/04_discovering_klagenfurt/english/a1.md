# Discovering Klagenfurt

After returning from Peru, Ben knew he needed to find a university.
But not just any university.
He wanted to study robotics and artificial intelligence.
He also wanted to be near mountains for snowboarding.
He wanted a beautiful place to live, not just study.

Ben spent weeks researching universities online.
He looked at programs in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.
Many had good robotics programs, but were in big, grey cities.
That was not what Ben wanted.

Then he found Klagenfurt.
Klagenfurt is a small city in southern Austria.
It sits next to a large, beautiful lake called Wörthersee.
The Alps are just a short drive away.
Italy is even closer.

The Alpen-Adria University in Klagenfurt offered exactly what Ben was looking for.
A bachelor's program in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.
The photos showed sunny days, clear water, and snow-covered mountains.
It seemed almost too good to be true.

Ben applied and was accepted.
He was nervous but excited.
He had never lived in Austria before.
He didn't know anyone there.
But those were the kinds of challenges he now welcomed.

Ben packed his things, including his most important possession: his snowboard.
If this didn't work out, he told himself, at least he would have had fun in the mountains.
With that attitude, he headed south to start a new chapter.

He had no idea just how important Klagenfurt would become.
